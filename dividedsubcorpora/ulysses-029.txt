He droned in vain.
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.
He sighed, aside:  —Ah me!
O my!
He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.
—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.
—Who may he be?
Mr Dedalus asked.
Lenehan opened most genial arms.
Who?
—Who may he be?
he asked.
Can you ask?
Stephen, the youthful bard.
Dry.
Mr Dedalus, famous fighter, laid by his dry filled pipe.
—I see, he said.
I didn’t recognize him for the moment.
I hear he is keeping very select company.
Have you seen him lately?
He had.
—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.
In Mooney’s en ville and in Mooney’s sur mer.
He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.
He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes.
—The élite of Erin hung upon his lips.
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor, and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O’Madden Burke.
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and  —That must have been highly diverting, said he.
I see.
He see.
He drank.
With faraway mourning mountain eye.
Set down his glass.
He looked towards the saloon door.
—I see you have moved the piano.
—The tuner was in today, Miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.
—Is that a fact?
—Didn’t he, Miss Kennedy?
The real classical, you know.
And blind too, poor fellow.
Not twenty I’m sure he was.
—Is that a fart?
Mr Dedalus said.
He drank and strayed away.
—So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.
God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.
Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell.
To the door of the diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.
Lager for diner.
Lager without alacrity she served.
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jingle jaunty blazes boy.
Upholding the lid he (who?)
gazed in the coffin (coffin?)
at the oblique triple (piano!)
wires.
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought.
Are you not happy in your home?
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.
Means something, language of flow.
Was it a daisy?
Innocence that is.
Respectable girl meet after mass.
Tanks awfully muchly.
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.
Hair streaming: lovelorn.
For some man.
For Raoul.
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jauntingcar.
It is.
Third time.
Coincidence.
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.
Follow.
Risk it.
Go quick.
At four.
Near now.
Out.
—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.
—Aha…I was forgetting…Excuse…  And four.
At four she.
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.
Bloo smi qui go.
Ternoon.
Think you’re the only pebble on the beach?
Does that to all.
For men.
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.
That was a    tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.
A call again.
That he now poised that it now throbbed.
You hear?
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.
Longer in dying call.
Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with Miss Douce.
—The bright stars fade .
.
.
A voiceless song sang from within, singing:  —…the morn is breaking.
A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.
—The dewdrops pearl…  Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.
—But look this way, he said, rose of Castille.
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castille.
Fretted forlorn, dreamily rose.
—Did she fall or was she pushed?
he asked her.
She answered, slighting:  —Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.
Like lady, ladylike.
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:  —See the conquering hero comes.
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.
See me he might.
The seat    he sat on: warm.
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft saluting.
—And I from thee…  —I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
He touched to fair Miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.
She smiled on him.
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.
Boylan bespoke potions.
—What’s your cry?
Glass of bitter?
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.
Wire in yet?
Not yet.
At four he.
All said four.
Cowley’s red lugs and Adam’s apple in the door of the sheriff’s office.
Avoid.
Goulding a chance.
What is he doing in the Ormond?
Car waiting.
Wait.
Hello.
Where off to?
Something to eat?
I too was just.
In here.
What, Ormond?
Best value in Dublin.
Is that so?
Diningroom.
Sit tight there.
See, not be seen.
I think I’ll join you.
Come on.
Richie led on.
Bloom followed bag.
Dinner fit for a prince.
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.
—O!
O!
jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.
O!
But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
—Why don’t you grow?
asked Blazes Boylan.
Shebronze, dealing from her jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?
), and syrupped with her voice:  —Fine goods in small parcels.
That is to say she.
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.
He pitched a broad coin down.
Coin rang.
—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I…  —Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.
—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.
—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.
Not on my own, you know.
Fancy of a friend of mine.
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at Miss Douce’s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
Idolores.
The eastern seas.
Clock whirred.
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.
Clock clacked.
Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.
It clanged.
Clock clacked.
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.
Look to the west.
A clack.
For me.
—What time is that?
asked Blazes Boylan.
Four?
O’clock.
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.
—Let’s hear the time, he said.
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.
Be near.
At four.
Has he forgotten?
Perhaps a trick.
Not come: whet appetite.
I couldn’t do.
Wait, wait.
Pat, waiter, waited.
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.
—Go on, pressed Lenehan.
There’s no-one.
He never heard.
—…to Flora’s lips did hie.
High, a high note, pealed in the treble, clear.
Bronzedouce, communing with her rose that sank and rose, sought Blazes Boylan’s flower and eyes.
—Please, please.
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
—I could not leave thee…  —Afterwits Miss Douce promised coyly.
—No, now, urged Lenehan.
Sonnezlacloche!
O do!
There’s no-one.
She looked.
Quick.
Miss Kenn out of earshot.
Sudden bent.
Two kindling faces watched her bend.
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it faltering.
—Go on!
Do!
Sonnez !
Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.
Delayed.
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.
—Sonnez !
Smack.
She let free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable woman’s warmhosed thigh.
—La cloche !
cried gleeful Lenehan.
Trained by owner.
No sawdust there.
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept!
aren’t men?
), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
Boylan, eyed, eyed.
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drankoff his tiny chalice, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.
He spellbound eyes went after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.
Yes, bronze from anearby.
—…Sweetheart, goodbye !
—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.
I wanted to tell you.
Tom Rochford…  —Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
Lenehan gulped to go.
—Got the horn or what?
he said.
Wait.
I’m coming.
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
—How do you do, Mr Dollard?
—Eh?
How do?
How do?
Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley’s woe.
He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.
We’ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.
Sighing, Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.
—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.
Come on, Simon, give us a ditty.
We heard the piano.
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders, Power for Richie.
And Bloom?
Let me see.
Not make him walk twice.
His corns.
Four now.
How warm this black is.
Course nerves a bit.
Refracts (is it?)
heat.
Let me see.
Cider.
Yes, bottle of cider.
—What’s that?
Mr Dedalus said.
I was only vamping, man.
—Come on, come on, Ben Dollar called.
Begone, dull care.
Come, Bob.
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.
His gouty paws plumped chords.
Plumped stopped abrupt.
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.
Bothered he wanted Power and cider.
Bronze by the window watched, bronze from afar.
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.
He’s off.
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.
Jingling.
He’s gone.
Jingle.
Hear.
—Love and war, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.
God be with old times.
Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.
Gone.
Pensive (who knows?
), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?)
about her bronze over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil  —Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.
There was.
—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.
The devil wouldn’t stop him.
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.
—God, do you remember?
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
They laughed all three.
He had no wed. All trio laughed.
No wedding garment.
—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.
Where’s my pipe by the way?
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.
Bald Pat carried two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.
And Father Cowley laughed again.
—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.
—You did, averred Ben Dollard.
I remember those tight trousers too.
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.
He saved the situa.
Tight trou.
Brilliant ide.
—I knew he was on the rocks, he said.
The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?
Do you remember?
We had to search all Holies street to find them till the chap in Keogh’s gave us the number.
Remember?
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.
—By God she had some luxurious opera cloaks and things there.
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.
—Merrion square style.
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.
He wouldn’t take any money either.
What?
Any God’s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose.
What?
—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.
Jingle haunted down the quays.
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
Liver and bacon.
Steak and kidney pie.
Right, sir.
Right, Pat.
Mrs Marion met him pike hoses.
Smell of burn of Paul de Kock.
Nice name he.
—What’s this her name was?
A buxom lassy.
Marion…  —Tweedy.
—Yes.
Is she alive?
—And kicking.
—She was a daughter of…  —Daughter of the regiment.
—Yes, begad.
I remember the old drummajor.
Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after.
—Irish?
I don’t know, faith.
Is she, Simon?
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.
—Buccinator muscle is…What?…Bit rusty…O, she is…My Irish Molly, O.
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
—From the rock of Gibraltar…all the way.
They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two, Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.
Pat served uncovered dishes.
Leopold cut liverslices.
As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.
Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate.
Dinners fit for princes.
By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun, in heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold.
Horn.
Have you the?
Horn.
Have you the?
Haw haw horn.
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:  —…When love absorbs my ardent soul…  Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery love-shivery roof-panes.
—War!
War!
cried Father Cowley.
You’re the warrior.
—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed.
I was thinking of your landlord.
Love or money.
He stopped.
He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.
—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard.
