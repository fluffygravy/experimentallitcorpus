Like tearing silk.
When she talks like the clapper of a bellows.
They can’t manage men’s intervals.
Gap in their voices too Fill me.
I’m warm, dark, open.
Molly in quis est homo: Mercadante.
My ear against the wall to hear.
Want a woman who can deliver the goods.
Jog jig jogged stopped.
Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.
O, look we are so!
Chamber music.
Could make a kind of pun on that.
It is a kind of music I often thought when she.
Acoustics that is.
Tinkling.
Empty vessels make most noise.
Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water.
Like those rhapsodies of Liszt’s, Hungarian, gipsyeyed.
Pearls.
Drops.
Rain.
Diddle iddle addle addle oodle oodle.
Hiss.
Now.
Maybe now.
Before.
One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock, with a loud proud knocker, with a cock carracarracarra cock.
Cockcock.
Tap.
—Qui sdegno, Ben, said Father Cowley.
—No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered, The Croppy Boy.
Our native Doric.
—Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.
Good men and true.
—Do, do, they begged in one.
I’ll go.
Here, Pat, return.
Come.
He came, he came, he did not stay.
To me.
How much?
—What key?
Six sharps?
—F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.
Bob Cowley’s outstretched talons gripped the black deepsounding chords.
Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince.
No, Richie said.
Yes, must.
Got money somewhere.
He’s on for a razzle backache spree.
Much?
He seehears lipspeech.
One and nine.
Penny for yourself.
Here.
Give him twopence tip.
Deaf, bothered.
But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home.
Hee hee hee hee.
Deaf wait while they wait.
But wait.
But hear.
Chords dark.
Lugugugubrious.
Low.
In a cave of the dark middle earth.
Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.
The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth’s fatigue made grave approach, and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true.
The priest he sought, with him would he speak a word.
Tap.
Ben Dollard’s voice barreltone.
Doing his level best to say it.
Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh.
Other comedown.
Big ships’ chandler’s business he did once.
Remember: rosiny ropes, ships’ lanterns.
Failed to the tune often thousand pounds.
Now in the Iveagh home.
Cubicle number so and so.
Number one Bass did that for him.
The priest’s at home.
A fake priest’s servant bade him welcome.
Step in.
The holy father.
Curlycues of chords.
Ruin them.
Wreck their lives.
Then build them cubicles to end their days in.
Hushaby.
Lullaby.
Die, dog.
Little dog, die.
The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footstep there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.
Decent soul.
Bit addled now.
Thinks he’ll win in Answers poets’ picture puzzle.
We hand you crisp five pound note.
Bird sitting hatching in a nest.
Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was.
See blank tee what domestic animal?
Tee dash ar most courageous mariner.
Good voice he has still.
No eunuch yet with all his belongings.
Listen.
Bloom listened.
Richie Goulding listened.
And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened.
The chords harped slower.
The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.
Ben’s contrite beard confessed: in nomine Domini, in God’s name.
He knelt.
He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa.
Latin again.
That holds them like birdlime.
Priest with the communion corpus for those women.
Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, corpusnomine.
Wonder where that rat is by now.
Scrape.
Tap.
They listened: tankards and Miss Kennedy, George Lidwell eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin, Kernan, Si.
The sighing voice of sorrow sang.
His sins.
Since easter he had cursed three times.
You bitch’s bast.
And once at masstime he had gone to play.
Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother’s rest he had not prayed.
A boy.
A croppy boy.
Bronze, listening by the beerpull, gazed far away.
Soulfully.
Doesn’t half know I’m.
Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.
Bronze gazed far sideways.
Mirror there.
Is that best side of her face?
They always know.
Knock at the door.
Last tip to titivate.
Cockcarracarra.
What do they think when they hear music?
Way to catch rattlesnakes.
Night Michael Gunn gave us the box.
Tuning up.
Shah of Persia liked that best.
Remind him of home sweet home.
Wiped his nose in curtain too.
Custom his country perhaps.
That’s music too.
Not as bad as it sounds.
Tootling.
Brasses braying asses through up trunks.
Doublebasses, helpless, gashes in their sides.
Woodwinds mooing cows.
Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws.
Woodwind like Goodwin’s name.
She looked fine.
Her crocus dress she wore, lowcut, belongings on show.
Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question.
Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa’s.
Hypnotised, listening.
Eyes like that.
She bent.
Chap in dresscircle, staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth.
Beauty of music you must hear twice.
Nature woman half a look.
God made the country man the tune.
Met him pike hoses.
Philosophy.
O rocks!
All gone.
All fallen.
At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell.
To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would.
Last of his name and race.
I too, last my race.
Milly young student.
Well, my fault perhaps.
No son.
Rudy.
Too late now.
Or if not?
If not?
If still?
He bore no hate.
Hate.
Love.
Those are names.
Rudy.
Soon I am old.
Big Ben his voice unfolded.
Great voice, Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom, soon old but when was young.
Ireland comes now.
My country above the king.
She listens.
Who fears to speak of nineteen four?
Time to be shoving.
Looked enough.
—Bless me, father, Dollard the croppy cried.
Bless me and let me go.
Tap.
Bloom looked, unblessed to go.
Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week.
Fellows shell out the dibs.
Want to keep your weathereye open.
Those girls, those lovely.
By the sad sea waves.
Chorusgirl’s romance.
Letters read out for breach of promise.
From Chickabiddy’s own Mumpsypum.
Laughter in court.
Henry.
I never signed it.
The lovely name you.
Low sank the music, air and words.
Then hastened.
The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock.
A yeoman captain.
They know it all by heart.
The thrill they itch for.
Yeoman cap.
Tap.
Tap.
Thrilled, she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.
Blank face.
Virgin should say: or fingered only.
Write something on it: page.
If not what becomes of them?
Decline, despair.
Keeps them young.
Even admire themselves.
See.
Play on her.
Lip blow.
Body of white woman, a flute alive.
Blow gentle.
Loud.
Three holes all women.
Goddess I didn’t see.
They want it: not too much polite.
That’s why he gets them.
Gold in your pocket, brass in your face.
With look to look: songs without words.
Molly that hurdygurdy boy.
She knew he meant the monkey was sick.
Or because so like the Spanish.
Understand animals too that way.
Solomon did.
Gift of nature.
Ventriloquise.
My lips closed.
Think in my stom.
What?
Will?
You?
I.
Want.
You.
To.
With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed.
Swelling in apoplectic bitch’s bastard.
A good thought, boy, to come.
One hour’s your time to live, your last.
Tap.
Tap.
Thrill now.
Pity they feel.
To wipe away a tear for martyrs.
For all things dying, want to, dying to, die.
For that all things born.
Poor Mrs Purefoy.
Hope she’s over.
Because their wombs.
A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing.
See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks.
On yonder river.
At each slow satiny heaving bosom’s wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly, sank red rose.
Heartbeats her breath: breath that is life.
And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.
But look.
The bright stars fade.
O rose!
Castille.
The morn.
Ha.
Lidwell.
For him then not for.
Infatuated.
I like that?
See her from here though.
Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.
On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands.
All lost in pity for croppy.
Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, repassed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.
With a cock with a carra.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
I hold this house.
Amen.
He gnashed in fury.
Traitors swing.
The chords consented.
Very sad thing.
But had to be.
Get out before the end.
Thanks, that was heavenly.
Where’s my hat.
Pass by her.
Can leave that Freeman.
Letter I have.
Suppose she were the?
No.
Walk, walk, walk.
Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell, Waaaaaaalk.
Well, I must be.
Are you off?
Yrfmstbyes.
Blmstup.
O’er ryehigh blue.
Bloom stood up.
Ow.
Soap feeling rather sticky behind.
Must have sweated: music.
That lotion, remember.
Well, so long.
High grade.
Card inside, yes.
By deaf Pat in the doorway, straining ear, Bloom passed.
At Geneva barrack that young man died.
At Passage was his body laid.
Dolor!
O, he dolores!
The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.
By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard.
You who hear in peace.
Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people.
He was the croppy boy.
Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy.
General chorus off for a swill to wash it down.
Glad I avoided.
—Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus said.
By God, you’re as good as ever you were.
—Better, said Tomgin Kernan.
Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour it is.
—Lablache, said Father Cowley.
Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.
Big Benaden Dollard.
Big Benben.
Big Benben.
Rrr.
And deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all laughing, they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.
—You’re looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.
Miss Douce composed her rose to wait.
—Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben’s fat back shoulderblade.
Fit as a fiddle, only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about bis person.
Rrrrrrsss.
—Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.
Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward.
Uncertainly he waited.
Unpaid Pat too.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.
—Mr Dollard, they murmured low.
—Dollard, murmured tankard.
Tank one believed: Miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the tank.
He murmured that he knew the name.
The name was familiar to him, that is to say.
That was to say he had heard the name of Dollard, was it?
Dollard, yes.
Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard.
He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina.
And The last rose of summer was a lovely song.
Mina loved that song.
Tankard loved the song that Mina.
’Tis the last rose of summer Dollard left Bloom felt wind wound round inside.
Gassy thing that cider: binding too.
Wait.
Postoffice near Reuben J’s one and eightpence too.
Get shut of it.
Dodge round by Greek street.
Wish I hadn’t promised to meet.
Freer in air.
Music.
Gets on your nerves.
Beerpull.
Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the.
Ben Howth.
That rules the world.
Far.
Far.
Far.
Far.
