He would.
—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added.
Half time, Ben.
Amoroso ma non troppo.
Let me there.
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout.
She passed a remark.
It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.
They drank cool stout.
Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?
And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring.
No, she couldn’t say.
But it would be in the paper.
O, she needn’t trouble.
No trouble.
She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten, Too much trouble, first gentlemen said.
O, not in the least.
Way he looked that.
Lord lieutenant.
Gold by bronze heard iron steel.
—............my ardent soul  I care notforor the morrow.
In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes.
Love and war someone is.
Ben Dollard’s famous.
Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert.
Trousers tight as a drum on him.
Musical porkers.
Molly did laugh when he went out.
Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking.
With all his belongings on show.
O, saints above, I’m drenched !
O, the women in the front row!
O, I never laughed so many!
Well, of course, that’s what gives him the base barrel-tone.
For instance eunuchs.
Wonder who’s playing.
Nice touch.
Must be Cowley.
Musical.
Knows whatever note you play.
Bad breath he has, poor chap.
Stopped.
Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave    solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering.
Good afternoon.
She gave her moist, a lady’s, hand to his firm clasp.
Afternoon.
Yes, she was back.
To the old dingdong again.
—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.
George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.
Bloom ate liv as said before.
Clean here at least.
That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle.
No-one here: Goulding and I.
Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins.
Pat to and fro, bald Pat.
Nothing to do.
Best value in Dub.
Piano again.
Cowley it is.
Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding.
Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the ‘cello, remind you of toothache.
Her high long snore.
Night we were in the box.
Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.
Conductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy.
Do right to hide them.
Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.
Only the harp.
Lovely gold glowering light.
Girl touched it.
Poop of a lovely.
Gravy’s rather good fit for a.
Golden ship.
Erin.
The harp that once or twice.
Cool hands.
Ben Howth, the rhododendrons.
We are their harps.
I.
He.
Old.
Young.
—Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.
Strongly.
—Go on, blast you, Ben Dollard growled.
Get it out in bits.
—M’appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld.
Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly.
Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell.
A headland, a ship, a    sail upon the billows.
Farewell.
A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.
Cowley sang:  —M’appari tutt amor:  Il mio sguardo I’incontr…  She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.
—Go on, Simon.
—Ah, sure my dancing days are done, Ben…Well…  Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.
—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned.
Play it in the original.
One flat.
The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
Up stage strode Father Cowley.
—Here, Simon.
I’ll accompany you, he said.
Get up.
By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingle jogged.
Steak, kidney, liver, mashed at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding.
Princes at meat they raised and drank Power and cider.
Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula.
He heard Joe Maas sing that one night.
Ah, that M’Guckin!
Yes.
In his way.
Choirboy style.
Maas was the boy.
Massboy.
A lyrical tenor if you like.
Never forget it.
Never.
Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.
Backache he.
Bright’s bright eye.
Next item on the programme.
Paying the piper.
Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box.
Stave it off awhile.
Sings too: Dozon among the dead men.
Appropriate.
Kidney pie.
Sweets to the.
Not making much hand of it.
Best value in.
Characteristic of him.
Power.
Particular about his drink.
Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water.
Fecking matches from counters to save.
Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs.
And when he’s wanted not a farthing.
Screwed refusing to pay his fare.
Curious types.
Never would Richie forget that night.
As long as he lived, never.
In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake.
And when the first note.
Speech paused on Richie’s lips.
Coming out with a whopper now.
Rhapsodies about damn all.
Believes his own lies.
Does really.
Wonderful liar.
But want a good memory.
—Which air is that?
asked Leopold Bloom.
—All is lost now.
Richie cocked his lips apout.
A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured all.
A thrush.
A throstle.
His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe.
Is lost.
Rich sound.
Two notes in one there.
Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley.
Taking my motives he twined and turned them.
All most too new call is lost in all.
Echo.
How sweet the answer.
How is that done?
All lost now.
Mournful he whistled.
Fall, surrender, lost.
Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.
Order.
Yes, I remember.
Lovely air.
In sleep she went to him.
Innocence in the moon.
Still hold her back.
Brave, don’t know their danger.
Call name.
Touch water.
Jingle jaunty.
Too late.
She longed to go.
That’s why.
Woman.
As easy stop the sea.
Yes: all is lost.
—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold.
I know it well.
Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.
He knows it well too.
Or he feels.
Still harping on his  daughter.
Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said.
Me?
Bloom askance over liverless saw.
Face of the all is lost.
Rollicking Richie once.
Jokes old stale now.
Wagging his ear.
Napkinring in his eye.
Now begging letters he sends his son with.
Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir.
Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money.
Apologise.
Piano again.
Sounds better than last time I heard.
Tuned probably.
Stopped again.
Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.
—With it, Simon.
—It, Simon.
—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.
—It, Simon.
—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.
By the sandwichbell in screening shadow, Lydia her bronze and rose, a lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.
The harping chords of prelude closed.
A chord longdrawn, expectant drew a voice away.
—When first I saw that form endearing.
Richie turned.
—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.
Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.
Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.
The door of the bar.
So.
That will do.
Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.
—Sorrow from me seemed to depart.
Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings of reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers, touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives.
Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard.
When first they saw, lost Richie, Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.
Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song.
Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet.
Love’s old sweet sonnez la gold.
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.
—Full of hope and all delighted…  Tenors get women by the score.
Increase their flow.
Throw flower at his feet when will we meet?
My head it simply.
Jingle all delighted.
He can’t sing for tall hats.
You head it simply swurls.
Perfumed for him.
What perfume does your wife?
I want to know.
Jing.
Stop.
Knock.
Last look at mirror always before she answers the door.
The hall.
There?
How do you?
I do well.
There?
What?
Or?
Phila of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel.
Yes?
Hands felt for the opulent.
Alas!
The voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.
—But alas, ‘twas idle dreaming…  Glorious tone he has still.
Cork air softer also their brogue.
Silly man!
Could have made oceans of money.
Singing wrong words.
Wore out his wife: now sings.
But hard to tell.
Only the two themselves.
If he doesn’t break down.
Keep a trot for the avenue.
His hands and  feet sing too.
Drink.
Nerves overstrung.
Must be abstemious to sing.
Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream.
For creamy dreamy.
Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling.
Full it throbbed.
That’s the chat.
Ha, give!
Take!
Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.
Words?
Music?
No: it’s what’s behind.
Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.
Bloom.
Flood of warm jimjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow, invading.
Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her.
Tup.
Pores to dilate dilating.
Tup.
The joy the feel the warm the.
Tup.
To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes.
Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrop.
Now!
Language of love.
—…ray of hope…  Beaming.
Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hope.
Martha it is.
Coincidence.
Just going to write.
Lionel’s song.
Lovely name you have.
Can’t write.
Accept my little pres.
Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too.
She’s a. I called you naughty boy.
Still the name: Martha.
How strange!
Today.
The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied.
It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting, to wait.
How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.
Wish I could see his face, though.
Explain better.
Why the barber in Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass.
Still hear it better here than in die bar though farther.
—Each graceful look…    First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure.
Yellow, black lace she wore.
Musical chairs.
We two the last.
Fate.
After her.
Fate.
Round and round slow.
Quick round.
We two.
All looked.
Halt.
Down she sat.
All ousted looked.
Lips laughing.
Yellow knees.
—Charmed my eye…  Singing.
Waiting she sang.
I turned her music.
Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees.
Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling.
First I saw.
She thanked me.
Why did she me?
Fate.
Spanishy eyes.
Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores.
At me.
Luring.
Ah, alluring.
—Martha !
Ah, Martha !
Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony.
In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must Martha feel.
For only her he waited.
Where?
Here there try there here all try where.
Somewhere.
—Co-me, thou lost one !
Co-me thou dear one I  Alone.
One love.
One hope.
One comfort me.
Martha, chestnote, return.
—Come!
It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don’t spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the ethereal bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessness-ness…  —To me!
Siopold!
Consumed.
Come.
Well sung.
All clapped.
She ought to.
Come.
To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.
—Bravo!
Clapclap.
Goodman, Simon.
Clappyclapclap.
Encore!
Clapclipclap.
Sound as a bell.
Bravo, Simon!
Clapclopclap.
Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze Miss Douce and gold Miss Mina.
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the bar-floor, said before.
Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Matthew, jaunted as said before just now.
Atrot, in heat, heatseated.
Cloche.
Sonnez la.
Cloche.
Sonnez la.
Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square.
Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.
An afterclang of Cowley’s chords closed, died on the air made richer.
And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two tankards if she did not mind.
Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second.
She did not mind.
—Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water.
