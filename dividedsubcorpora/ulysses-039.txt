Because it’s arranged.
Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the stars.
Little piece of steel iron.
When you hold out the fork.
Come.
Come.
Tip.
Woman and man that is.
Fork and steel.
Molly, he.
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.
Tip.
Have to let fly.
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.
Shame all put on before third person.
More put out about a hole in her stocking.
Molly, her underjaw stuck out head back, about the fanner in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.

Wait.
Hm.
Hm.
Yes.
That’s her perfume.
Why she waved her hand.
I leave you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow.
What is it?
Heliotrope?
No, Hyacinth?
Hm.
Roses, I think.
She’d like scent of that kind.
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.
Why Molly likes opoponax.

For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark.
Mysterious thing too.
Why did I smell it only now?
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.
Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.
Yes, it is.
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.
Tell you what it is.
It’s like a fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, rainbow colours without knowing it.
Clings to everything she takes off.
Vamp of her stockings.
Warm shoe.
Stays.
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.
Byby till next time.
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.
Know her smell in a thousand.

Wonder where it is really.
There or the armpits or under the neck.
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.
Hyacinth perfume made of oil or ether or something.
Muskrat.
Bag under their tails one grain pour off odour for years.
Dogs at each other behind.
Good evening.
Evening.
How do you sniff?

Hm.
Very well, thank you.
Animals go by that.
Yes now, look at it that way.
We’re the same.
Some women for instance warn you off when they have their period.
Come near.
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.
Like what?
Potted herrings gone stale or.
Boof!
Please keep off the grass.
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.
What though?
Cigary gloves Long John had on his desk the other.
Breath?
What you eat and drink gives that.
No.

O by the by that lotion.
I knew there was something on my mind.
Never went back and the soap not paid.
Dislike carrying botdes like that hag this morning.
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.
I could mention Meagher’s just to remind him.
Still if he works that paragraph.
Two and nine.
Bad opinion of me he’ll have.
Call tomorrow.
How much do I owe you?
Three and nine?
Two and nine, sir.
Ah.
Might stop him giving credit another time.
Lose your customers that way.
Pubs do.
Fellow run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.
Here’s this nobleman passed before.
Blown in from the bay.
Just went as far as turn back.
Always at home at dinnertime.
Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in.
Enjoying nature now.
Grace after meals.
After supper walk a mile.
Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit.
Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.
Still you learn something.
See ourselves as others see us.
So long as women don’t mock what matter?
That’s the way to find out.
Ask yourself who is he now.
The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom.
Payment at the rate of one guinea per column.
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.
Corns on his kismet however.

Still two types there are you bob against.
Scowl or smile.
Pardon!
Not at all.
Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun.
Some light still.
Red rays are longest.

A star I see.
Venus?
Can’t tell yet.
Two, when three it’s night.
Were those nightclouds there all the time?
Looks like a phantom ship.
No.
Wait.
Trees are they.
An optical illusion.
Mirage.
Land of the setting sun this.
Homerule sun setting in the southeast.
My native land, goodnight.
Dew falling.
Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone.
Brings on white fluxions.

Might get piles myself.
Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth.
Cut with grass or paper worst.

Like to be that rock she sat on.
O sweet little, you don’t know how nice you looked.
I begin to like them at that age.
Green apples.
Grab at all that offer.
Suppose it’s the only time we cross legs, seated.
Also the library today: those girl graduates.
Happy chairs under them.
But it’s the evening influence.
They feel all that.
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.
Nightstock in Mat Dillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder.
Wish I had a full length oil-painting of her then.

And now?
Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.
They take  All quiet on Howth now.
The distant hills seem.
Where we.
The rhododendrons.

Where I come in.
All that old hill has seen.
Names change: that’s all.
Lovers: yum yum.
Tired I feel now.
Will I get up?
O wait.
Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch.
She kissed me.
My youth.
Never again.
Only once it comes.
Or hers.
Take the train there tomorrow.
No.
Returning not the same.
Like kids your second visit to a house.
The new I want.
Nothing new under the sun.
Care of P. O. Dolphin’s barn.

Curious she an only child, I an only child.
So it returns.
Think you’re escaping and run into yourself.
Longest way round is the shortest way home.
And just when he and she.
Circus horse walking in a ring.
Rip van Winkle we played.
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat.

Ba.
Again.
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.
They’re a mixed breed.
Birds are like hopping mice.
What frightens them, light or noise?
Better sit still.
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.
Weeny bones.
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.

Birds too never find out what they say.
Like our small talk.
And says she and says he.
Nerve?
they have to fly over the ocean and back.
Lot must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.
Dreadful life sailors have too.
Big brutes of ocean-going steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.
Faugh a ballagh.
Out of that, bloody curse to you.
Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.
Married too.
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.
No ends really because it’s round.
Wife in every port they say.
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.
If ever he does.
Smelling the tail end of ports.

Yet they do.
The anchor’s weighed.
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.
Well?
And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on his door to touch.
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.

They floated, fell: they faded.
The shepherd’s hour: the hour of holding: hour of tryst.
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace.
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop press edition !
Result of the Gold Cup race !
and from the door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called.
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.
Howth settled for slumber tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly die night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.
