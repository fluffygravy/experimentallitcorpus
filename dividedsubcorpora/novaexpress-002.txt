The needle was edging to NOVA.
Minutes to go.
Burnt metal smell of interplanetary war in the raw noon streets swept by screaming glass blizzards of enemy flak.
He dispersed on grey sliding between light and shadow down mirror streets and shadow pools.
Yes he was wising up the marks.
Willy The Fink they called him among other things, syndicates of the universe feeling for him with distant fingers of murder.
He stopped in for a cup of "Real English Tea Made Here" and a thin grey man sat at his table with inflexible authority.
"Nova Police.
Yes I think we can quash the old Nova Warrants.
Work with us.
We want names and coordinate points.
Your application for Biologic Transfer will have to go through channels and is no concern of this department.
Now we'll have a look at your room if you don't mind."
They went through his photos and papers with fingers light and cold as spring wind.
Grey Police of The Regulator, calm and grey with inflexible authority.
Willy had worked with them before.
He knew they were undercover agents working under conditions as dangerous as his own.
They were dedicated men and would sacrifice him or any other agent to arrest The Nova Mob:  "Sammy The Butcher," "Green Tony," "Iron Claws," "The Brown Artist," "Jacky Blue Note," "Limestone John," "Izzy The Push," "Hamburger Mary," "The Subliminal Kid," "The Green Octopus," and "Willy The Rat," who wised up the marks on the last pitch.
And they took Uranus apart in a fissure flash of metal rage.
As he walked past The Sargasso Café black insect flak of Minraud stabbed at his vitality centers.
Two Lesbian Agents with glazed faces of grafted penis flesh sat sipping spinal fluid through alabaster straws.
He threw up a Silence Screen and grey fog drifted through the café.
The deadly Silence Virus.
Coating word patterns.
Stopping abdominal breathing holes of The Insect People Of Minraud.
The grey smoke drifted  the grey that stops shift  cut  tangle they breathe medium the  word cut  shift  patterns words cut  the  insect tangle cut  shift that coats word cut  breath  silence shift abdominal  cut  tangle stop word holes.
He did not stop or turn around.
Never look back.
He had been a professional killer so long he did not remember anything else.
Uranian born of Nova Conditions.
You have to be free to remember and he was under sentence of death in Maximum Security Birth Death Universe.
So he sounded the words that end “Word” –  Eye take back color from “word” –  Word dust everywhere now like soiled stucco on the buildings.
Word dust without color drifting smoke streets.
Explosive bio advance out of space to neon.
At the bottom of the stairs Uranian Willy engaged an Oven Guard.
His flesh shrank feeling insect claws under the terrible dry heat.
Trapped, cut off in that soulless place.
Prisoner eaten alive by white hot ants.
With a split second to spare he threw his silver blast and caught the nitrous fumes of burning film as he walked through the door where the guard had stood.

He knew what it meant to kick an SOS habit: White hot agony of thawing metal - And the suffocating panic of carbon dioxide withdrawal –  Virus defined as three-dimensional coordinate point of a controller - Transparent sheets with virus perforations like punch cards passed through the host on the soft machine feeling for a point of intersection - The virus attack is primarily directed against affective animal life - Virus of rage hate fear ugliness swirling round you waiting for a point of intersection and once in immediately perpetrates in your name some ugly noxious or disgusting act sharply photographed and recorded becomes now part of the virus sheets constantly presented and represented before your mind screen to produce more virus word and image around and around it's all around you the invisible hail of bring down word and image –  What does virus do wherever it can dissolve a hole and find traction?

- Quote, Newseek, Feb. 12, 1962 –  The Crab Nebula observed by the Chinese in 1054 A.D. is the result of a supernova or exploding star - Situated approximately three thousand light years from the earth - (Like three thousand years in hot claws at the window - You go it?
-) - Before they blow up a star they have a spot picked out as many light years away as possible - Then they start draining all the fuel and charge to the new pitch and siphon themselves there right after and on their way rejoicing - You notice we don't have as much time as people had say a hundred years ago?
- Take your clothes to the laundry write a letter pick up your mail at American Express and the day is gone - They are short-timing us as many light years as they can take for the getaway - It seems that there were survivors on The Crab Pitch who are not in all respects reasonable men - And The Nova Law moving fast - So they start the same old lark sucking all the charge and air and color to a new location and then?
- Sput - You notice something is sucking all the flavor out of food the pleasure out of sex the color out of everything in sight?
- Precisely creating the low pressure area that leads to nova - So they move cross the wounded galaxies always a few light years ahead of the Nova Heat - That is they did - The earth was our set - And they walked right into the antibiotic handcuffs - IT will readily be seen that having created one nova they must make other or answer for the first - I mean three thousand years in hot claws at the window like a giant crab in slag heaps of smouldering metal - Also the more novas the less time between they are running out of pitches - So they bribe the natives with a promise of transportation and immortality –  "Yeah, man flesh and junk and charge stacked up bank vaults full of it - Three thousand years of flesh - So we leave the bloody apes behind and on our way rejoicing right?
- It's the only way to live -"  And the smart operators fall for it every fucking time - talk about marks - One of our best undercover operators is known as the Rube - He perfected The Reverse Con- Comes on honest and straight and the smart operators all think they are conning him - How could they think otherwise until he slips on the antibiotic handcuffs –  "There's a wise guy born every minute," he says.
"Closing time gentlemen - The stenographer will take your depositions -"  "So why did I try to blow up the planet?
- Pea under the shell - Now you see it now you don't - Sky shift to cover the last pitch - Take it all out with us and hit the road - I am made of metal and that metal is radioactive - Radioactivity can be absorbed up to a point but radium clock hands tick away - Time to move on - Only one turnstile - Heavy planet - Travel with Minraud technicians to handle the switchboard and Venusians to make flesh and keep the show on the road - Then The Blazing Photo and we travel on - Word is flesh and word is two that is the human body is compacted of two organisms and where you have two you have word and word is flesh and when they started tampering with the word that was it and the blockade was broken and The Nova Heat moved in - The Venusians sang first naturally they were in the most immediate danger - They live underwater in the body with an air line - And that air line is the word - Then the technicians spilled and who can blame them after the conditions I assigned to keep them technicians - Like three thousand years in hot claws - So I am alone as always - You understand nova is where I am born in such pain no one else survives in one peace - Born again and again cross the wounded galaxies - I am alone but not what you call 'lonely' - Loneliness is a product of dual mammalian structure - 'Loneliness,' 'love,' 'friendship,' all of the rest of it - I am not two - I am one - But to maintain my state of oneness I need two ness in other life forms - Other must talk so that I am remain silent - If another becomes one then I am two - That makes two ones make two and I am no longer one - Plenty of room in pace you say?
- But I am not one in space I am one in time - Metal time - Radioactive time - So of course I tried to keep you all out of space - That is the end of time - And those who were allowed out sometimes for special services like creating a useful religious concept went always with a Venusian guard - All the 'mystics' and 'saints' - All except my old enemy Hassan I Sabbah who wised up the marks to space and sad they could be one and need no guard no other half no word–  "And now I have something to say to all you angle boys of the cosmos who thought you had an in with the Big Operators - 'Suckers!

- "Mr. Martin si" Disaster Snow - Crack - Sahhk - Numb - Just a fluke came in with the tide and The Swedish River of Gothenberg –   The Death Dwarf in the Street  Biologic Agent K9 called for his check and picked up supersonic imitation blasts of The Death Dwarfs — "L'addition — Laddition — Laddittion — Garcon — Garcon — Garcon" — American tourist accent to the Nth power — He ordered another coffee and monitored the café — A whole table of them imitating word forms and spitting back at supersonic speed — Several patrons rolled on the floor in switch fits — These noxious dwarfs can spit out a whole newspaper in ten seconds imitating your words after you and sliding in suggestion insults — That is the entry gimmick of The Death Dwarfs: supersonic imitation and playback so you think it is your own voice — (do you own a voice?)
they invade The Right Centers which are The Speech Centers and they are in the right — in the right — in thee write — "RIGHT" — "I'm in the right — in the right — You know I'm in the right so long as you hear me say inside your right centers 'I am in the right'" — While Sex Dwarfs tenderize erogenous holes — So The Venusian Gook Rot flashed round the world —  Agent K9 was with The Biologic Police assigned to bring the Dwarf Plague under control by disconnecting the dwarfs from Central Control Station: The Insect Brain of Minraud enclosed in a crystal cylinder from which run the cold wires to an array of calculating machines feeding instructions to The Death Dwarf In The Street — The brain is surrounded by Crab Guards charged from the Thermodynamic Pain and Energy Bank — Crab Guards can not be attacked directly since they are directly charged by attack — K9 had been in combat with The Crab Guards and he knew what can happen if they get their claws on your nerve centres —  K9 left the café and surveying the street scene he could not but feel that someone had goofed — The Death Dwarfs had in many cases been separated from the human host but they were still charged from Central Control and yacked through the streets imitating words and gestures of everyone in sight — While Sex Dwarfs squirmed out of any cover with a perfunctory, "Hello there," in anyone who stood for it, dissolved erogenous holes immediately attacked by The Talk Dwarfs so that in a few seconds the unfortunate traveler was torn to pieces which the dwarfs snatch from each other's mouth with shrill silver screams — In fact the noxious behavior of this life form harried the citizens beyond endurance and everyone carried elaborate home-made contrivances for screening out the Talk Dwarfs and a special plastic cover to resist erogenous acids of the Sex Dwarfs —  Without hesitation K9 gave the order: "Release Silence Virus — Blanket area" — So The Silence Sickness flashed round the world at speed of light — As a result many citizens who had been composed entirely or work went ape straight away and screamed through the streets attacking the passers-by who in many cases went ape in turn as The Silence Sickness hit — To combat these conditions, described as "intolerable," political leaders projected stern noble image from control towers and some could occupy and hold up the ape forms for a few days or weeks — Invariably the leader was drained by the gravity of unregenerate apes, torn in pieces by his relapsing constituents, or went ape himself on TV — So the Survivors as they call themselves lived in continual dread of resistant dwarfs always more frantic from host hunger — Knowing that at any minute the man next to you in the street might go Mandril and leap your your throat with virginal canines — K9 shrugged and put in a call for Technicians — "The error in enemy strategy is now obvious — It is machine strategy and the machine can be redirected — Have written connection in The Soft Typewriter the machine can only repeat your instructions since it can not create anything — The operation is very technical — Look at a photomontage — It makes a statement in flexible picture language — Let us call the statement made by a given photomontage X — We can use X words X colors X odors X images and so forth to define the various aspects of X — Now we feed X into the calculating machine and X scans out related colors, juxtapositions, affect- charged images and so forth we can attenuate or concentrate X by taking out or adding elements and feeding back into the machine factors we wish to concentrate — A Technician learns to think and write in association blocks which can then be manipulated according to the laws of association and juxtaposition — The basic law of association and conditioning is known to college students even in America: Any object, feeling, odor, word, image in juxtaposition with any other object feeling, odor, word or image will be associated with it — Our technicians learn to read newspapers and magazines for juxtaposition statements rather than alleged content — We express these statements in Juxtaposition Formulae — The Formulae of course control populations of the world — Yes it is fairly easy to predict what people will think see feel and hear a thousand years from now if you write the Juxtaposition Formulae to be used in that period — But the technical details you understand and the machines — all of which contain basic flaws and must be continually overhauled, checked, altered whole block of computing machines purged and disconnected from one minute to the next — fast our mind waves and long counts — And let me take this opportunity of replying to the criticisms of my creeping opponents — It is not true that I took part in or instigated experiments defining pain and pleasure thresholds — I used abstract reports of the experiments to evolve the formulae of pain and pleasure association that control this planet — I assume no more responsibility than a physicist working from material presented to an immobilized brain — I have constructed a physics of the human nervous system or more accurately the human nervous system defines the physics I have constructed — Of course I can construct another system working on quite different principals — Pain is a quantitative factor — So is pleasure — I had material from purge trials and concentration camps and reports from Nagasaki and Hiroshima defining the limits of courage — Our most precise data came from Lexington Ky. where the drug addicts of America are processed — The pain of heroin withdrawal in the addict lends itself perfectly to testing under control conditions — Pain is quantitative to degree of addiction and stage

The cadet looked at the ground and said: "I didn't mean anything."
He walked down a wooden ramp to a school desk of shellacked brown maple where a woman sat.
"Where have you been?"
"I have been to The Far Assembly Meeting-I am on my way back to school-"  "What Assembly Meeting?
Where?"
"The Far Assembly Meeting-Over there-"  "That's a lie.
The Far Assembly Meeting is in that direction."
He composed his face for Basic Pain as he had been taught to compose his face to show nothing.
"I have been to a meeting," he said.
"You have six hours forced work-Guard-"  And the club crushed into his ribs and kidneys and the sides of his neck jabbed his testicles and stomach no matter how he did or did not do the work assigned and loss of composure was punishable by death.
Then taken back to World Trade School K9 and whether he walked fast or slow or between slow and fast more bone-crushing shocks fell through him-So the cadets learn The Basic Formulae of Pain and Fear- Rules and staff change at arbitrary intervals-Cadets encouraged or forced into behavior subject to heaviest sanctions of deprivation, prolonged discomfort, noise, boredom all compensation removed from the offending cadets who were always being shifted from one school to another and never knew if they were succeeding brilliantly or washed out report to disposal-  Lee woke with his spine vibrating and the smell of other cigarette smoke in his room- He walked streets swept by color storms slow motion in spinal fluid came to the fish city of marble streets and copper domes -Along canals of terminal sewage-the green boy-girls tend gardens of pink flesh-Amphibious vampire creatures who breathe in other flesh-double sex sad as the drenched lands of swamp delta to a sky that does not change-Where flesh circulates stale and rotten as the green water-by purple fungoid gills--They breathe in flesh-settling slow in caustic green enzymes dissolving body-eating gills adjusted to the host's breathing rhythm-eat and excrete through purple gills and move in a slow settling cloud of sewage-They are in pairs known as The Other Half-the invisible Siamese twin moving in and out of one body-talk in slow flesh grafts and virus patterns exchanging genital sewage breathe in and out of each other on slow purple gills of half sleep with cruel idiot smiles eating Terminal Addicts of The Orgasm Drug under a sign cut in black stone:  The Nature of Begging Need?-Lack.

What weighted the program down was refusal to leave-  "Well what are you going to do?
Perhaps alone?"
"You'd like to do half of it for me would you?"
He slung me out and Worth and Vicky talked usefully about that was that Maybe I've met Two Of A Kind-They both started share of these people-Vicky especially sounded him-It wasn't what he had-You know is why?
What they are meant to do is all?- Going to get out of it?

An interview with further scream along the line-  White sat quietly beaming "human people" out of hospital and others started putting their time on casual -Effects Boys anyway after that-Chinese accusation of a bargain- What are we going to do level on average?-I was on the roof so I had to do Two Of A Kind-They both started before doing sessions-There's no choice-Sounded him-Have to let it go cheap and start do is all-A journey, man-The job will be there -No punishment and reward business-   A Distant Thank You  "I am having in Bill&Iam," she said-  "But they don't exist-tout ça-my dear have you any idea what-certain basic flaws in the-"  "You can afford it-You told me hole is always there to absorb yesterday-and whatever-"  "The Market you understand-Bill tossed a rock and a very dear friend of mine struck limestone with dried excrement purposes.
And what purpose more has arisen -quite unlooked for-"  "All the more reason to redecorate Silent Workers-"  They had arrived where speech is impossible.
"lam is very technical," said Bill as he walked around smoking smoke patterns in the room-"Have flash language of The Silent Ones-Out all this crap-Tonight, Madame- Age to grim Gothic Foreman-"  The Studio had set up a desert reek Mayan back to peasant hut-In a few minutes there mountain slope of the Andes-House had stood in the air-  "Limestone country," said Bill-"We might start with a photo-collage of The House- yes?-of course and the statues in clear air fell away to a Mayan Ball Court with eternal gondolas-a terminal life form of bookies and bettors changing black berries in little jade pipes-slow ebb of limestone luck and gills-Controllers of The Ugly Spirit Spinal Fluid-hydraulic vegetable centuries-"  "But what about The House Itself?"
"Lost their enemy-ah yes Madame, The House- You are Lady-Can't we contact them?-I mean well taken care of I hope-"  "I think, Bill, they exist at different pressure-"  "Ah yes The House-Hummm-Permutate at different pressure and sometimes a room is lost in-"  "Bill, they exist at different pressure-"  "In the shine?-The Bensons?-But they don't exist-Tout ça c'est de l'invention-There are of course certain basic flaws in the hydraulic machinery but the marl hole is always there to absorb the uh errors-"  At the bottom of the crater was a hole-Bill tossed a rock and the echo fainter and fainter as the rock struck limestone on down-Silence-  "Bottomless you see for practical purposes-and what purpose more practical than disposal??"
Slow The House merged created in silent concentration of the workers from The Land Of Silence where speech is impossible-  "Lucky bastards," Bill always said as he walked around smoking Havanas and directing the work in color flash language of The Silent Ones-showing his plans in photo-collage to grim Gothic foreman-  And The House moved slowly from Inca to Mayan back to peasant but in blighted maize fields or windy mountain slopes of The Andes-Gothic cathedrals soared and dissolved in air-The walls were made of blocks that shifted and permutated-cave paintings-Mayan relief-Attic frieze-panels-screens-photo-collage of The House in all periods and stages-Greek temples rose in clear air and fell to limestone huts by a black lagoon dotted with gondolas-a terminal life form of languid beautiful people smoking black berries in little jade pipes∗-And The Fish People with purple fungoid gills-And The Controllers drifting in translucent envelopes of spinal fluid with slow hydraulic gestures of pressure authority-These people are without weapons-so old they have lost their enemy-  "But they are exquisite," said The Lady.
"Can't we contact them?-I mean for dinner or cocktails?-"  "It is not possible, Madame-They exist at different pressure-"  "I am having in Bill&Iam"-she said during breakfast-  Her husband went pale-"My dear, have you any idea what their fee is?- "  "You can afford it-You told me only yesterday-"  "That was yesterday and whatever I may have told you in times long past-The Market you understand- Something is happening to money itself-A very dear friend of mine found his special deposit box in Switzerland filled with uh dried excrement-In short an emergency a shocking emergency has arisen-quite unlooked -for-"  "All the more reason to redecorate-There they are now- They had arrived-Bill in "banker drag he calls it now isn't that cute?"
"lam is very technical"-said Bill puffing slowly on his Havana and watching smoke patterns-"Have to get some bulldozers in here-clean out all this crap-Tonight, Madame, you sleep in a tent like the Bedouin-"  The Studio had set up a desert on the lawn and The Family was moved out In a few hours there was only a vast excavation where The House had stood-  "Limestone country," said Bill touching outcrops on walls of the crater-"  "We might start with a Mayan temple-or The Greeks-"  "Yes of course and the statuary-City Of Marble Flesh Grafts-I envisage a Mayan Ball Court with eternal youths-and over here the limestone bookmakers and bettors changing position and pedestal- slow ebb of limestone luck-and just here the chess players-one beautiful the other ugly as The Ugly Spirit-playing for beauty-slow game of vegetable centuries-"  "But what about The House itself?
"-said The Lady-   *Reference to the Pakistan Berries, a small black fruit of narcotic properties sometimes brought to southern Morocco by caravan-when smoked conjures the area of black lagoons sketched in these pages- "Ah yes, Madame, The House-You are comfortable in your present quarters and well taken care of I hope-I think your son is very talented by the way-Hummm-perhaps- ah yes The House-Gothic Inca Greek Mayan Egyptian-and also something of the archaic limestone hut you understand the rooms and walls permutate on hydraulic hinges and jacks and sometimes a room is lost in-"  "In the shuffle-The Bensons-during breakfast-"  Her husband went pale-"C'est l'invention-Fee is?"
"Fee is hydraulic machinery marl yesterday errors told you in times long past-at the bottom of the crater was happening to money itself-echo fainter and fainter special deposit box in Switzerland-"  "A shocking emergency-"  "Bottomless you see for practical pee-practical disposal -There they are now-"  Slow the House merged-created in drag he calls it.
"Isn't that cute?-Workers from The Land Of Silence whiffing slowly on his Havana and watching-"  " `Lucky Bill' always said: `Get some bulldozers in here.'
"  The Family was moved and The House moved slowly-only a vast excavation in blighted maize fields and wind-Gothic cathedrals soared on walls of the crater - Blocks shifted relief and panel screens of marble flesh grafts-  "I envisage stages-Gothic Cathedral soured-And over here the limestone huts by a black lagoon dotted position and pedestal-smoke chess players-and Fish People playing for beauty-slow games in their translucent envelopes-"  "Gestures of Pressure Author-" said The Lady-  "You understand so old they are comfortable in present quarters-"  "But they are exquisite"-said Tower Son-(very talented by the way for dinner or cocktails Gothic Inca Mayan Greek Egyptian-and also-)  "You understand the rooms and walls-and sometimes a room is lost-"  "They exist at different pressure playing their slow games by The Black Lagoon-You understand the mind works with une rapidité incroyable but the movements are very slow-So a player may see on the board great joy or a terrible fate see also the move to take or avoid see also that he can not make the move in time- This gives rise of course to great pain which they must always conceal in a round of exquisite festivals-"  The lagoon now was lighted with flicker lanterns in color-floating temples pagodas pyramids-  "The festivals rotate from human sacrifice to dawn innocence when the envelope dissolves-This happens very rarely-They cultivate The Fish People like orchids or pearls-always more exquisite strains blending beauty and vileness-strains of idiot cruelty are specially prized-" He pointed to a green newt creature with purple fungoid gills that stirred in a clear pool of water under limestone outcroppings and ferns-  "This amphibious-hermaphrodite strain is motivated by torture films-So their attractions are difficult to resist -"  The green boy-girl climbed out on a ledge-A heavy narcotic effluvia drifted from his half open mouth- Her squirmed towards the controller with little chirps and giggles- The controller reached down a translucent hand felt absently into the boneless jelly caressing glands and nerve centers-The green boy-girl twisted in spasms of ingratiation-  "They are very subservient as you can see in the right hands-But we must make an excursion to the place of The Lemur People who die in captivity-They are protected- We are all protected here-Nothing really happens you understand and the human sacrifice takes a bow from the flower floats-It is all exquisite and yet would you believe me we are all intriguing to unload this gold brick on some rube for an exit visa -Oh there's my travel agent the controller engaged-"  Playing their slow games by man in the black suit with long mind-works with une rapidité-  "He has been cheating me for months-slow so that a player may see believe the ridiculous travel arrange great joy and see also the move to fastest brain-"  "Yes we have all-Can not make the move in time-This other here-Roles must conceal in anything to go."
"If we could only just flush our flower floats on child track without a body from human sacrifice-"  "Rather bad taste, Old-Thing-Whose-Envelope-Has-Dissolved-The Flayed Man Stand- "  "They Cultivate The Fish People-"  "Oh yes whose doing it?"
"Not for more exquisite strains-??"
"I tell you nobody can scream-Over there is The Land of The Lemur People-"  "He dissolved after the performance-Beautiful strain of idiot cruelty-"  "So he got his exit visa?-and green newt creature with purple fungoid now?"
"Pool of water under limestone-He has contacted someone-Know is motivated by torture films-"  "Willy The Rube?-I knew him to resist-The green boy climbed hook and he fades out with Effluvia-drifted from his half open mouth all our exquisite food and smoke bones-He fade out in word giggles-He beat Green Tony into The Green Boy-Girl's Boneless Dream Concession-He defend nerve centers-The Green Boy twisted in Sammy The Butcher-"  "Still he may fall for The Hero-They are very subservient -"  "We are an old people you are sus-Make an excursion to the land of persona and statuary-They are protected of course-Here is he now-Really happens you understand-"  "I understand you people need the flower floats-It is all Mongolian Archers-They are- we are all scheming to unload an exit visa-" (The controller engaged short furtive conversation-man in a black suit with one long fingernail and gold teeth-)  "He has been cheating me for months of course they all do-You wouldn't believe the ridiculous travel arrangements they unload on our fastest brains-Yes we have all been laughing stock at one time or another- Here where roles and flesh circulate- There is no place for anything to go-"  "If we could only just flush ourselves down the drain," she said seeing her life time fortunes fade on The Invisible Board-  "Rather bad taste, old thing-Embalm yourself-Tonight is The Festival Of The Flayed Man-"  "Oh yes and whose doing it?
Juanito again?-"  "He dissolved after the last performance-"  "Oh yes he went away-And what is The Travel Agent selling you now?"
"He has contacted someone known as Willy the Rube-perhaps-"  "Willy The Rube?
?-I know him from Uranus- Think you have him on the hook and he fades out with a train whistle-He beat Green Tony in a game of limestone stud and walked out with The Dream Concession-He defenestrated Izzy the Push and cowboyed Sammy The Butcher."
"Still he may fall for The Hero: Protect us-We are an old people-Protect our exquisite poisonous life and our statuary-Well?"
"Here is he now."
"I understand you people need protection-I am moving in a contingent of Mongolian Archers-They are expensive of course but well worth it-"  The Mongolian Archers with black metal flesh moved in grill arrangements of a ritual dance flexing their bows-silver antennae arrows sniffing dowsing quivering for The Enemy-  "My dear, they make me terribly nervous-Suppose there is no enemy??"
"That would be unfortunate, Madame-My archers must get relief-You did ask for protection and now-Where are the Lemur People?"
The Lemur People live on islands of swamp cypress peering from the branches and it took many hours to coax them down-Iridescent brown copper color- liquid black eye screens swept by virginal emotions-  "They are all affect you understand-That is why they die in captivity-" A Lemur touched The Rube's face with delicate tentative gestures and skittered again into the branches-  "No one has ever been able to hold a lemur for more than a few minutes in my memory-And it is a thousand years since anyone had intercourse with a lemur- The issue was lost-They are of such a delicacy you understand the least attempt-thought of holding or possessing and they are back in the branches where they wait the master who knew not hold and possess-They have waited a long time-Five hundred thousand years more or less I think-The scientists can never make up their mind about anything-"  The lemur dropped down on Lee's shoulder and playfully nipped his ear-Other lemurs raised sails on a fragile bamboo craft and sailed away over the lagoon under the red satellite that does not change position-  "There are other islands out there where no one has ever been-The lemurs of such delicacy that they die if one sets foot on the island-They exist at different prenatal flesh in black lagoons-"  "You understand silver arrows sniffing pointing incroyable but the movements on The Board a terrible doom: (`Suppose there is no enemy?')
Take or avoid but see also that gives rise to great pain-You did a round of exquisite festivals-"  "Me see your lemur people with flicker lights in swamp cypress?"
"Hours to coax them down-Finally the dawn innocence of control sent liquid flickering screens like pearl-All affect, you understand, that is blending beauty and flesh-"  A Lemur touched Lee's face with delicate people who die in captivity-skittering again into the specially prized-this stressing they are back in who will not hold and possess-out on a ledge-a heavy narcotic indeed-thousand years more or less-  The Mongolian Archers with short black conversation of ritual dancing flexed there-- dowzing feeling for The Enemy like of course they all do-  "You wouldn't-"  "My dear, they make me terrible arrangements that have been sold to our-"  "That would be unfortunate, Madame- Been laughing stock at one time or ask for protection-and now-"  "Tonight is the festival of Nice Young Emotions-Why they die in captivity-Juanito again?-Where is he now?-"  "Branches no one has ever been-He far now is-"  "They are of such a hat-Is your travel agent selling you attempt or thought of holding the branches where they wait?"
"Perhaps-They have waited a long time-Five Uranus-"  "The Pakistan Berries lay all our dust of a distant thank you on Lee's shoulder-"   Remember I Was Carbon Dioxide  Nothing here now but the recordings-in another country.

GAVE PROOF THROUGH THE NIGHT  (This section, first written in 1938 in collaboration with Kells Elvins who died in 1961, New York, was later cut back in with the "first cut-ups" of Brion Gysin as published in Minutes to Go.)
Captain Bairns was arrested today in the murder at sea of Chicago-He was The Last Great American to see things from the front and kept laughing during the dark-Fade out  S.S. America-Sea smooth as green glass-off Jersey Coast-An air-conditioned voice floats from microphones and ventilators-:  "Keep your seats everyone-There is no cause for alarm-There has been a little accident in the boiler room but everything is now/"   BLOOOMMM  Explosion splits the boat-The razor inside, sir-He jerked the handle-  A paretic named Perkins screams from his shattered wheelchair:  "You pithyathed thon of a bidth."
Second Class Passenger Barbara Cannon lay naked in First Class State Room-Stewart Hudson stepped to a porthole:  "Put on your clothes, honey," he said.
"There's been an accident."
Doctor Benway, Ship's Doctor, drunkenly added two inches to a four-inch incision with one stroke of his scalpel-  "Perhaps the appendix is already out, doctor," the nurse said peering over his shoulder-"I saw a little scar- "  The appendix OUT!
I'M taking the appendix out-What do you think doing here?"
"Perhaps the appendix is on the left side, doctor- That happens sometimes you know-"  "Stop breathing down my neck-I'm coming to that-Don't you think I know where an appendix is?-I studied appendectomy in 1910 at Harvard-" He lifted the abdominal wall and searched along the incision dropping ashes from his cigarette-  "And fetch me a new scalpel-This one has no edge to it"-   BLOOOMM  "Sew her up," he ordered-"I can't be expected to work under such conditions"-He swept instruments cocaine and morphine into his satchel and tilted out of The Operating Room-  Mrs. J. L. Bradshinkel, thrown out of bed by the explosion , sat up screaming: "I'm going right back to The Sheraton Carlton Hotel and call the Milwaukee Braves"-   Two Philippine maids hoisted her up-"Fetch my wig, Zalameda," she ordered.
"I'm going straight to the captain-"  Mike B. Dweyer, Politician from Clayton Missouri, charged the First Class Lounge where the orchestra, high on nutmeg, weltered in their instruments-  "Play The Star Spangled Banner," he bellowed.
"You trying to corn somebody, Jack?-We got a union-"  Mike crossed to the jukebox, selected The Star Spangled Banner With Fats Terminal at The Electric Organ, and shoved home a handful of quarters-   Oh say can you seeeeeeeeee   The Captain sitting opposite Lucy Bradshinkel-He is shifty redhead with a face like blotched bone-  "I own this ship," The Lady said-  The deck tilted and her wig slipped over one ear- The Captain stood up with a revolver in his left hand -He snatched the wig and put it on-  "Give me that kimono," he ordered-  She ran to the porthole screaming for help like everyone else on the boat-Her head was outlined in the porthole-He fired-  "And now you God damned old fool, give me that kimona-"   I mean by the dawn's early light   Doctor Benway pushed through a crowd at the rail and boarded The First Life Boat-  "Are you all right?"
he said seating himself among the women-"I'm the doctor."
The Captain stepped lightly down red carpeted stairs-In The Purser's Office a narrow- shouldered man was energetically shoving currency and jewels into a black suitcase- The Captain's revolver swung free of his brassiere and he fired twice-   By the rockets red glare   Radio Operator Finch mixed a bicarbonate of soda and belched into his hand-"SOS- URP-SOS-God damned captain's a brown artist-SOS-Off Jersey Coast-SOS-Might smell us-SOS-Son of a bitching crew-SOS-URP-Comrade Finch-SOS-Comrade in a pig's ass-SOS-SOS-SOS-URP-URPURP -"  The Captain stepped lightly into The Radio Room-Witnesses from a distance observed a roaring blast and a brilliant flash as The Operator was arrested-The Captain shoved the body aside and smashed the apparatus with a chair-   Our flag was still there   The Captain stiff-armed an old lady and filled The First Life Boat-The boat was lowered jerkily by male passengers-Doctor Benway cast off-The crew pulled on the oars-The Captain patted his bulging suitcase absently and looked back at the ship-   Oh say do that star spangled banner yet wave   Time hiccoughs-Passengers fighting around Life Boat K9--It is the last boat that can be launched-Joe Sargant, Third Year Divinity student and MRA, slipped through the crowd and established Perkins in a seat at the bow-Perkins sits there chin drawn back eyes shining clutching a heavy butcher knife in his right hand   By the twilight's last gleamings   Hysterical waves from Second Class flood the deck-"Ladies first," screamed a big faced shoe clerk with long teeth-He grabbed a St. Louis matron and shoved her ahead of him-A wedge of shoe clerks formed behind -A shot rang and the matron fell The wedge scattered-A man with nautical uniform buttoned in the wrong holes carrying a World War 1 45 stepped into the last boat and covered the men at the launching ropes-  "Let this thing down," he ordered-The boat hit the water-A cry went up from the reeling deck-Bodies hurtled around the boat Heads bobbed in the green water-A hand reached out of the water and closed on the boat side--Spring-like Perkins brought down his knife-The hand slipped away-Finger stubs fell into the boat-Perkins worked feverishly cutting on all sides:  "Bathdarths-Thons of bidth-Bathdarth-thon bidth-Methodith Epithcopal God damn ith-"   O'er the land of the freeee   Barbara Cannon showed your reporter her souvenirs of the disaster: A life belt autographed by the crew and a severed human finger-   And the home of the brave   "I don't know," she said.
"I feel sorta bad about this old finger."
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there   SOS  The cold heavy fluid settled in a mountain village of slate houses where time stops- Blue twilight-Place Of The Silence Addicts-They move in and corner SOS and take it away in lead bottles and sit there on the nod in slate houses-On The Cool Blue or The Cold Grey-leave a wake of yapping ventriloquist dummies -They just sit there in cool blocks of blue silence and the earth's crust undulates under their weight of Heavy Time and Heavy Money-The Blue Heavy Metal People Of Uranus-Heavy con men selling issues of fraudulent universe stock-It all goes back into SOS-[Solid Blue Silence.]
"Nobody can kick an SOS habit, kid-All the screams from The Pain Bank-from The Beginning you understand exploded deep in the tortured metal."
Junk poured through my screaming flesh-I got up and danced The Junky Jig-I had my spoons-That's all I need-Into his spine falling some really great shit lately ("Shoot your way to peat bog") The cold heavy fluid settled-hydraulic beginning you understand- Exploded time stops in blue metal-Surburban galaxies on the nod- blue silence in the turnstile-village of slate houses-This foreign sun in bottles-  Martin came to Blue junction in a heavy blue twilight where time stops-Slow hydraulic driver got out and moved away-Place of The Silent People-The Foreman showed him to The Bunk House-The men sat in blocks of cool blue silence at a long table and laid out photos in silent language of juxtaposition projecting the work- playing poker for position and advantage-  The work was hard and silent-There were irrigation canals and fish ponds with elaborate hydraulic locks and motors-The windmills and weather maps- (The Proprietor took photos of sky clouds and mountains every day moving arranging his weather maps in a vast flicker cylinder that turned with the wind on roof of The Main Building-Picture panels on walls of The Bunk House and Day Room changed with weather sky and mountain shadows in a silent blue twilight- The men took photos of each other and mixed picture composites shifting combos to wind and water sounds and frogs from the fish pools-(green pastures crisscrossed with black water and springs overhung with grass where Martin fished in the evening with Bradly who slept in the bunk next to his or in his bunk back and forth changing bodies in the blue silence-Tasks shifted with poker play and flesh trade-)  Blue-Flicker along the fish ponds-Blue shadows twilight-street frogs and crickets- (crisscrossed my face )  The knife fell-The Clerk in the bunk next to his bled blue silence-Put on a clean shirt and Martin's pants-telling stories and exchanging smiles-dusty motors-The crop and fish talk muttering American dawn words-Sad rooming house-Picture wan light on suburban ponds and brown hair-Grey photo pools and springs over brass bed-Stale morning streets- sifting clouds and sky on my face-crisscrossed with city houses-  "Empty picture of a haunted ruin?"
He lifted his hands sadly turned them out .

"Some boy just wrote last good-bye across the sky .

All the dream people of past time are saying good-bye forever, Mister" Late afternoon shadows against his back magic of all movies in remembered kid standing there face luminous by the attic window in a lost street of brick chimneys exploded star between us .

Short Count  The Heavy Metal Kid returned from a short blue holiday on Uranus and brought suit against practically everybody in The Biologic Courts-  "They are giving me a short count," he said in an interview with your reporter-"And I won't stand still for it-" Fade out  Corridors and patios and porticos of The Biologic Courts-Swarming with terminal life forms desperately seeking extension of canceled permissos and residence certificates-Brokers, fixers, runners, debarred lawyers, all claiming family connection with court officials – Professional half-brothers and second cousins twice removed – Petitioners and plaintiffs screaming through the halls – Holding up insect claws, animal and bird parts, all manner of diseases and deformities received “In the service” of distant fingers – Shrieking for compensations and attempting to corrupt or influence the judges in a thousand languages living and dead, in color flash and nerve talk, catatonic dances and pantomimes illustrating their horrible conditions which many have tattooed on their flesh to the bone and silently picket the audience chamber – Others carry photo-collage banners and TV screens flickering their claims – Willy’s attorneys served the necessary low pressure processes and The Controllers were sucked into the audience chamber for the The First Hearing – Green People in limestone calm – Remote green contempt for all feelings and proclivities of the animal host they had invaded with inexorable moves of Time-Virus-Birth-Death – With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms – Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes – And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music – Cold insect brains like white hot buzz saws sharpened in the Ovens – The judge, many light years away from possibility of corruption, grey and calm with inflexible authority reads the brief – He appears sometimes as a slim young man in short sleeves then middle-aged and slim young man in short sleeves then middle-aged and red-faced sometimes very old like yellow ivory “My God what a mess” – he said at last – “Quiet all of you – You all understand I hope what is meant by biologic mediation – This means that the mediating life forms must simultaneously lay aside all defenses and all weapons – it comes to the same thing – and all connection with retrospective controllers under space conditions merge into a single being which may or may not be successful -" He glanced at the brief-"It would seem that The Uranians represented by the plaintiff Uranian Willy and The Green People represented by Ali Juan Chapultepec are prepared to mediate-Will these two uh personalities please stand forward- Bueno-I expect that both of you would hesitate if you could see-Fortunately you have not been uh overbriefed-You must of course surrender all your weapons and we will proceed with whatever remains-Guards-Take them to the disinfection chambers and then to The Biologic Laboratories"-He turned to The Controllers-"I hope they have been well prepared-I don't need to tell you that Of course this is only The First Hearing-The results of mediation will be reviewed by a higher court-"  Their horrible condition from a short blue holiday on Uranus-Post everybody in The Biologic Courts: Willy's attorney served "Count.

All your junk out in apomorphine-All your time and money out in word dust drifting smoke streets-Dream street of body dissolves in light .

The Sick Junk God snatches The Writ: "Put him in The Ovens-Burn his writing"-He runs down a hospital corridor for The Control Switch-"He won't get far."
A million police and partisans stand quivering electric dogs-antennae light guns drawn-  "You called The Fuzz-You lousy fink-"  "They are your police speaking your language-If you must speak you must answer in your language-"  "Stop-Alto-Halt-" Flashed through all I said a million silver bullets-The Junk God falls- Grey dust of broom swept out by an old junky in backward countries–  A heavy blue twilight drifting forward snatches The Writ Time-Money-Junk gather to buy: "Put him in The Ovens-Burn his writing-"  "Say only The Angel Profound Lord of D-Runs down a hospital corridor-Your bodies I have written- Your death called the police-The junk God sick from "Stop-Alto-Halt-" The Junk God falls in a heavy blue twilight drifting over the ready with drawn guns- Time-Money-Junk on all your languages-Yours-Must answer them-Your bodies-I have written your death hail of silver bullets-So we are now able to say not.

THIS HORRIBLE CASE  Angle boys of the cosmos solicit from lavatories and broom closets of the Biologic Court Buildings charge out high on ammonia peddling fixes on any case from The Ovens Rap to a summons for biologic negligence-After buying a few short fixes in rigged courts, the pleaders defendants court officials and guilty bystanders learn to use a filter screen that scans out whole wave-lengths of ill-intentioned lunacy-This apparatus, sold in corridors and patios of the court buildings, enables any life form in need of legal advice to contact an accredited biologic counselor trained in the intricacies and apparent contradictions of biologic law-The classic case presented to first year students is The Oxygen Impasses: Life Form A arrives on alien planet from a crippled space craft-Life Form A breathes "oxygen" -There is no "oxygen" in the atmosphere of alien planet but by invading and occupying Life Form B native to alien planet they can convert the "oxygen" they need from the blood stream of Life Form B-The Occupying Life Form A directs all the behavior and energies of Host Life Form B into channels calculated to elicit the highest yield of oxygen-Health and interest of the host is disregarded-Development of the host to space stage is arrested since such development would deprive the invaders by necessity of their "oxygen" supply- For many years Life Form A remains invisible to Life Form B by a simple operation scanning out areas of perception where another life form can be seen-However an emergency a shocking emergency quite unlooked-for has arisen-Life Form B sees Life Form A-(Watching you have they thought debarred) and brings action in The Biologic Courts alleging unspeakable indignities, metal and physical cruelty, deterioration of mind body and soul over thousands of years, demanding summary removal of the alien parasite-To which Form B replies at The First Hearing: "It was a question of food supply-of absolute need-Everything followed from that: Iron claws of pain and pleasure squeezing a planet to keep the host in body prison working our òxygen' plants-Knowing that if he ever saw even for an instant who we are and what we are doing-(Switched our way is doomed in a few seconds)-And now he sees us planning to use the host as a diving suit back to our medium where of course Life Form B would be destroyed by alien conditions-Alternative posed by the aroused partisans fumbling closer and closer to the switch that could lock us out of Form B and cut our òxygen' lines-So what else could we do under the circumstances?
The life form we invaded was totally alien and detestable to us-We do not have what they call èmotions’-soft spots in the host marked for invasion and manipulation-  The Oxygen Impasse is a basic statement in the algebra of absolute need-"Oxygen" interchangeable factor representing primary biologic need of a given life form-From this statement the students prepare briefs-sift cut and rearrange so they can view the case from varied angles and mediums:  The trial of The Nova Mob brought in emergency quite unlooked-for: Broom arisen- sweeps Life Form B-Sees fixes in The Biologic Courts-Deterioration of mind body and soul buying a few short fixes in rigged Any Place-Learns the years-the long-the many- such a place-scans out whole lengths of alien parasite -and brings action from unspeakable indignities and negligence demanding summary biologic lawyers who never hustle a form-The best criminal counselor was Uranian U-His clients from heavy metal-Impression Thing followed from that Iron Claws Brief-From one interview he got Sammy squeezing a planet in The Switch-The Green Octopus working Vegetable Sentence -And now they have seen there is no "oxygen" in the diving suit Local life would be destroyed by the "oxygen" they breathe-  'This pressure-Health cut our òxygen' lines-so disregarded-"  "So that the circumstances?"
"Life of the host beyond `THE' detestable to us- Would deprive the invaders by soft spots in the host-"  With the material you have nature of absolute need and The First Hearing in Biologic Court-  "Alleging you understand I must fight indignities and cruelties and the natives are all mind body and soul demanding and I can't account for poison-(to which of course I have never lost a client)-Specific facts and cases a question of food supply not adequate-Owed from that the two claws intimidate and corrupt-"  "Enables an arrested criminal of pleasure and pain to squeeze counselor trained in the body-prison contradictions of biologic law-Diving suit of thousand years back to our medium instead of The Reverse Switch- Alternative Word Island-"  So where to first year students of Biologic Law Circumstances?-Life Form A was totally alien crippled space craft-Do not have what they call "emotion's oxygen" in the atmosphere-  A student who represents Life Form A must anticipate questions of the Biologic Prosecutor:-  "How did the space craft `happen' to be crippled in such convenient proximity?-Was not the purpose of the expedition to find òxygen' and extract it by any means?- During many years of occupancy was any effort towards biologic reconversion made by Life Form A prior to intervention of The Biologic Police?
Was not Life Form A conspiring to cut off the òxygen' of Life Form B as soon as their `travel arrangements' were completed?
Did they not in fact plan to liquidate Life Form B by cutting off èmotion's oxygen' the charge on which human and other mammalian life forms run?- (Doctor W. Reich has suggested that human life is activated by units he calls òrgones' which form a belt around the planet)--Life Form A obviously conspired to blockade the orgone belt and leave Form B to suffocate in a soulless vacuum at the high surface temperatures that obtain on Life Form A’s planet of origin: 600 Degrees Fahrenheit-"  In short the plea of need offered by Life Form A is inadequate-To prepare a case would be necessary to investigate the original conditions and biologic history of Life Form A on location-A Biologic Counselor must know his client and be "trained in the body-prison contradictions of biologic law"-It will not be easy for Form A to find a counselor willing to handle "this horrible case-"   Brief For First Hearing  Biologic Counselors must be writers that is only writers can qualify since the function of a counselor is to create facts that will tend to open biologic potentials for his client-One of the great early counselors was Franz Kafka and his briefs are still standard-The student first writes his own brief -then folds his pages down the middle and lays it on pages of Kafka relevant to the case in hand- (It is not always easy to say what is and is not relevant)-To indicate the method here is a tentative brief for The First Hearing in Biologic Court:-A preparation derived from one page of Kafka passed through the student's brief and the original statement back and forth until a statement of biologic position emerges-From this original statement the student must now expand his case—  QUOTE FROM The Trial-FRANZ KAFKA "I fancy," said the man who was stylishly dressed, "that the gentleman's faintness is due to the atmosphere here-You see it's only here that this gentleman feels upset, not in other places-" Accustomed as they were to the office air felt ill in the relatively fresh air that came up from the stairway-They could scarcely answer him and the girl might have fallen if K had not shut the door with the utmost haste-He had already, so he would relate, won many similar cases either outright or partially-That was very important for the first impression made by the defense frequently determined the whole course of subsequent proceedings-Especially when a case they had conducted was suddenly taken out of their hands-That was beyond all doubt the worst thing that could happen to an advocate- Not that a client ever dismissed an advocate from the case-For how could he keep going by himself once he had pulled in someone to help him?-But it did sometimes happen that a case took a turn where the advocate could no longer follow it-The case and the accused and everything was simply withdrawn from the advocate-Then even the best connection with officials could no longer achieve any result-For even they knew nothing-The case had simply reached the stage where further assistance was ruled out-It had vanished into remote inaccessible courts where even the accused was beyond the reach of an advocate- The advocate's room was in the very top attic so that if you stumbled through the hole your leg hung down into the lower attic in the very corridor where the clients had to wait-   Brief For First Hearing// Case Of Life Form A  They sometimes mutate to breathe "here"-The gentleman is Biologic Court Building "here"-You see it's only "here" fixes any case from The Ovens-Not in other places- after buying the relatively fresh air-Life Form A arrives on worst thing that could happen to a space craft-Life Form A breathes from the atmosphere of alien planet- Form A directs all behavior withdrawn from the advocate into channels calculated to no longer achieve health and interest of the host-The case had simply reached to space stage-Assistance was ruled out Even the accused was beyond years- Life Form A's room was in the very top- "  "I fancy," said the man who was on alien planet, "that crippled faintness is due to the òxygen'-There is no òxygen' this gentleman feels but by invading and occupying `the office air' they can convert the òxygen' up from the stairway of Life Form B."
The first impression made determines whole course of subsequent "oxygen" supply-A shocking emergency case-For how could he keep Form A?
?- Sees someone to help him but it debarred action in turn-Could scarcely answer the people of Minraud-Brain directs all movement-Use a filter screen that scans the door with intentioned lunacy- Won many similar cases operating through telepathic misdirection-There has been dismissed an advocate from Minraud-Pulled in and replaced-Worst thing that could happen to present heads-Sometimes happened that a case took total weapons-The principal no longer follow it-The case had simply reached molten core of a planet where assistance was ruled out-  "I fancy," said the man, "that this gentleman feels white hot blue skies-Haste he had already so?"

The best criminal counselor was similar case operating through metal-Impression followed to present interview-He got Sammy advocate from Minraud-Pulled in and replaced history of Life Form A on location-  Clearly this is a difficult case to defend particularly considering avowed intention of the accused to use the counselor as a diving suit back to their medium where counselor would be destroyed by alien conditions-There is however one phrase in the brief on which a defense can be constructed-"They sometimes mutate to breathe here"-That is if a successful mutation of Life Form A can be called in as witness- Clearly the whole defense must be based on possibility of mutation and the less said about "absolute biologic need" to maintain a detrimental parasitic existence at the total expense of Form B the better chance of a compromise verdict suspended pending mutation proceedings-   Two Tape Recorder Mutations  "I fancy," said the man, "this gentleman feels totally stupid and greedy Venus Power-Tentacles write out message from stairway of slime-"  "That's us-Strictly from `Sogginess Is Good For You'-Planning no bones but an elementary nervous system-Scarcely answer him-"  "The case simply at terminal bring down point-Desperate servants suddenly taken out of their hands-Insane orders and counter orders on the horizon-And I playing psychic chess determined the whole civilization and personal habits-"  "Iron claws of pain and pleasure with two speeds- with each recorder in body prison working our 'here' on extension leads-Even for an instant not in operation the host recorder saw the loudspeakers-Way is doomed in relatively soundproof `room'- Would shift door led to the array-Many recorders important for our oxygen lines-Each to use host connected to its respective recorder layout-For example with nine recorders determined the life form we invaded by three square-Each recorder marked for invasion recording -You see it's only `here' fixes nature of need set to run for as long as required-Ìndignities' and `cruelties' are playing back while other record-Intimidate' and "corrupt ' speed and volume variation-Squeeze host back into system-Any number of tape recorders banked together for ease of operation switch in other places- Our mikes are laid out preferably in `fresh air'-That's us-Planning speaker and mike connected to host Scarcely answer him-Of course static and moving are possible-Very simplest array would be three lines- Two speeds can be playing especially when àcase' has four possible states-Fast manipulation suddenly taken out of slow playback-The actual advocate from biologic need in many ways-  "a-Simple hand switching advocate  "b-Random choice fixed interval biologic stairway- The whole thing is switched on either outright or partially-at any given time recorders fix nature of absolute need- Thus sound played back by any `cruelties' answer him either unchanged or subject to alien planet-  "c-Sequential choice i.e.

(The cabin reeks of exploded star).

Broken sky through my nostrils- Dead bare knee against the greasy dust Faded photo drifting down across pubic hair, thighs, rose wallpaper into the streets of Pasto-The urinals and the bicycle races here in this boy were gone when I woke up- Whiffs of my Spain down the long empty noon-Brief moments I could describe-The great wind revolving lips and pants in countries of the world-Last soldier's fading-Violence is shut off Mr. Bradly Mr.-I am dying in a room far away-last-Sad look-Mr. Of The Account, I am dying-In other flesh now Such dying-Remember hints as we shifted windows the visiting moon air like death in your throat?-The great wind revolving lip smoke, fading photo and distance Whispers of junk, flute walks, shirt flapping-Bicycle races here at noon-boy thighs- Sad-Lost dog-He had come a long way for something not exchanged .
