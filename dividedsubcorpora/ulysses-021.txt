—Trouble?
Nosey Flynn said.
Not that I heard of.
Why?
—I noticed he was in mourning.
—Was he?
Nosey Flynn said.
So he was, faith.
I asked him how was all at home.
You’re right, by God.
So he was.
—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.
—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.
She’s well nourished, I tell you.
Plovers on toast.
—And is he doing for the Freeman?
Davy Byrne said.
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.
—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up.
You can make bacon of that.
—How so?
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.
He winked.
—He’s in the craft, he said.
—Do you tell me so?
Davy Byrne said.
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.
Ancient free and accepted order.
Light, life and love, by God.
They give him a leg up.
I was told that by a, well, I won’t say who.
—Is that a fact?
—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.
They stick to you when you’re down.
I know a fellow was trying to get into it, but they’re as close as damn it.
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:  —Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!
—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.
That was one of the Saint Legers of Doneraile.
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tear-washed eyes:  —And is that a fact?
Decent quiet man he is.
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him, you know, over the line.
—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.
Didn’t you see him look at his watch?
Ah, you weren’t there.
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.
Declare to God he does.
—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.
He’s a safe man, I’d say.
—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.
He has been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.
Give the devil his due.
O, Bloom has his good points.
But there’s one thing he’ll never do.
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.
—I know, Davy Byrne said.
—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.
Tom Rochford followed, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.
—Day, Mr Byrne.
—Day, gentlemen.
They paused at the counter.
—Who’s standing?
Paddy Leonard asked.
—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.
—Well, what’ll it be?
Paddy Leonard asked.
—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
—How much?
Paddy Leonard cried.
Since when, for God’s sake?
What’s yours, Tom?
—How is the main drainage?
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Air Byrne?
he said.
—Certainly, sir.
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.
—Lord love a duck, he said, look at what I’m standing drinks to!
Cold water and gingerpop!
Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.
A dead snip.
—Zinfandel is it?
Nosey Flynn asked.
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.
—Is it Zinfandel?
—Say nothing, Bantam Lyons winked.
I’m going to plunge five bob on my own.
—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.
Who gave it to you?
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.
—So long, Nosey Flynn said.
The others turned.
—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
—Prrwht!
Paddy Leonard said with scorn.
Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a…  —Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.
—Ay, Paddy Leonard said.
A suckingbottle for the baby.
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.
Something green it would have to be: spinach say.
Then with those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobble stones and lapped it with new zest.
Surfeit.
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.
First sweet then savoury.
Mr Bloom coasted warily.
Ruminants.
His second course.
Their upper jaw they move.
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his.
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth.
Lean people long mouths.
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.
Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo, the closes of the bars:  Don Giovanni, a cenar teco  M’invitasti.
Feel better.
Burgundy.
Good pick me up.
Who distilled first?
Some chap in the blues.
Dutch courage.
That Kilkenny People in the national library now I must.
Bare clean dosestools, waiting, in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body, changing biliary duct, spleen squirting liver, gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.
Science.
—A cenar teco.
What does that teco mean?
Tonight perhaps.
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited  To come to supper tonight,  The rum the rumdum.
Doesn’t go properly.
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.
That’ll be two pounds ten, about two pounds eight.
Three Hynes owes me.
Two eleven.
Presscott’s ad.
Two fifteen.
Five guineas about.
On the pig’s back.
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.
Today.
Today.
Not think.
Tour the south then.
What about English watering places?
Brighton, Margate.
Piers by moonlight.
Her voice floating out.
Those lovely seaside girls.
Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.
Handy man wants job.
Small wages.
Will eat anything.
Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore.
Why I left the church of Rome?
Bird’s Nest.
Women run him.
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.
Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews.
Same bait.
Why we left the church of Rome?
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.
No tram in sight.
Wants to cross.
—Do you want to cross?
Mr Bloom asked.
The blind stripling did not answer.
His wall face frowned weakly.
He moved his head uncertainly.
—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.
Moles-worth street is opposite.
Do you want to cross?
There’s nothing in the way.
The cane moved out trembling to the left.
Mr Bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dye-works’ van drawn up before Drago’s.
Where I saw his brilliantined hair just when I was.
Horse drooping.
Driver in John Long’s.
Slaking his drouth.
—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving.
I’ll see you across.
Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
—Yes, the stripling answered.
South Frederick street.
—Come, Mr Bloom said.
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.
Say something to him.
Better not do the condescending.
They mistrust what you tell them.
Pass a common remark:  —The rain kept off.
No answer.
Stains on his coat.
Slobbers his food, I suppose.
Tastes all different for him.
Have to be spoonfed first.
Like a child’s hand his hand.
Like Milly’s was.
Sensitive.
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.
Wonder if he has a name.
Van.
Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs tired drudge get his doze.
That’s right.
Clear.
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.
—Thanks, sir.
Knows I’m a man.
Voice.
—Right now?
First turn to the left.
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.
Poor young fellow!
How on earth did he know that van was there?
Must have felt it.
See things in their foreheads perhaps.
Kind of sense of volume.
Weight.
Would he feel it if something was removed?
Feel a gap.
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.
Could he walk in a beeline if he.hadn’t that cane?
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.
Penrose!
That was that chap’s name.
Look at all the things they can learn to do.
Read with their fingers.
Tune pianos.
Or we are surprised they have any brains.
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.
Of course the other senses are more.
Embroider.
Plait baskets.
People ought to help.
Work basket I could buy Molly’s birthday.
Hates sewing.
Alight take an objection.
Dark men they call them.
Sense of smell must be stronger too.
Smells on all sides bunched together.
Each person too.
Then the spring, the summer: smells.
Tastes.
They say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.
And with a woman, for instance.
More shameless not seeing.
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.
Look at me.
I have them all on.
Must be strange not to see her.
Kind of a form in his mind’s eye.
The voice temperature when he touches her with fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.
His hands on her hair, for instance.
Say it was black for instance.
Good.
We call it black.
Then passing over her white skin.
Different feel perhaps.
Feeling of white.
Postoffice.
Must answer.
Fag today.
Send her a postal order two shillings half a crown.
Accept my little present.
Stationer’s just here too.
Wait.
Think over it.
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.
Again.
Fibres of fine fine straw.
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.
Downy hair there too.
Not smooth enough.
The belly is the smoothest.
No-one about.
There he goes into Frederick street.
Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano.
Might be settling my braces.
Walking by Doran’s public house he slid his hand between waistcoast and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.
But I know it’s whiteyellow.
Want to try in the dark to see.
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
Poor fellow!
Quite a boy.
Terrible.
Really terrible.
What dreams would he have, not seeing?
Life a dream for him.
Where is the justice being born that way?
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.
Holocaust.
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pikehoses.
Dear, dear, dear.
Pity of course: but somehow you can’t cotton on to them someway.
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons’ hall.
Solemn as Troy.
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.
I sentenced him to ten years.
I suppose he’d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court.
Welhneaning old man.
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.
Sends them to the rightabout.
The devil on moneylenders.
Gave Reuben J. a great strawcalling.
Now he’s really what they call a dirty jew.
Power those judges have.
Crusty old topers in wigs.
Bear with a sore paw.
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Hello, placard.
Minis bazaar.
His excellency the lord lieutenant.
Sixteenth today it is.
In aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital.
The Messiah was first given for that.
Yes Handel.
What about going out there.
Ballsbridge.
Drop in on Keyes.
No use sticking to him like a leech.
Wear out my welcome.
Sure to know someone on the gate.
Mr Bloom came to Kildare Street.
First I must.
Library.
Straw hat in sunlight.
Tan shoes.
Turnedup trousers.
It is.
It is.
His heart quopped softly.
To the right.
Museum.
Goddesses.
He swerved to tie right.
Is it?
Almost certain.
Won’t look.
Wine in my face.
Why did I?
Too heady.
Yes, it is.
The walk.
Not see.
Not see.
Get on.
Making for the museum gate with long windy strides he lifted his eyes.
Handsome building.
Sir Thomas Deane designed.
Not following me?
Didn’t see me perhaps.
Light in his eyes.
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.
Quick.
Cold statues: quiet there.
Safe in a minute.
No, didn’t see me.
After two.
Just at the gate.
My heart!
His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.
Look for something I.
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim.
Where did I?
Busy looking for.
He thrust back quickly Agendath.
Afternoon she said.
I am looking for that.
Yes, that.
Try all pockets.
Handker.
Freeman.
Where did I?
Ah, yes.
Trousers.
Purse.
Potato.
Where did I?
Hurry.
Walk quietly.
Moment more.
My heart.
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.
