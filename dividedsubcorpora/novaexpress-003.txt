Smorbrot  Operation Sense Withdrawal∗ is carried out in silent lightless immersion tanks filled with a medium of salt bouillon at temperature and density of the human body-Cadets enter the tank naked and free floating a few inches apart permutate on slow currents-soon lose the outlines of body in shifting contact with phantom limbs-Loss of outline associated with pleasant sensations -frequently orgasms occur-  K9 took off his clothes in a metal-lined cubicle with a Chinese youth-Naked he felt vertigo and a tightening of stomach muscles as they let themselves down into the tank and floated now a few inches apart warm liquid swirling through legs and genitals touching-His hands and feed lost outline-There was sudden sharp spasm in his throat and a taste of blood-The words dissolved-His body twisted in liquid fish spasms and emptied through his spurting penis-feeling other spasms shiver through the tank-He got out and dresses with a boy from The Alameda-Back in flesh-street boy words in his throat Kerosene light on a Mexican about twenty felt his pants slide down his stomach his crotch unbuttoned sighed and moved his ass off-He was naked now in lamp-Mexican rolled marijuana cigarette-naked body of the other next to his turning him over on his stomach-his crotch unbuttoned wind and water sounds- sighed and moved his ass in shadow pools on rose wallpaper-brass bed stale against him-Felt naked body of the other explode in his spine-Room changed with flesh-Felt his pants slide-The cadet's ass was naked now -A few inches apart in the tank the Mexican-His lips felt propositions -A few inches apart K9 moved his ass in scratching shower-Wave of pleasure through his stomach-He was floating moving in food-City of Chili Houses exploded in muscles and the words went in-There in his throat Kerosene light on with street boy- Outskirts of The City-First spurts of his crotch-  The naked cadets entered a warehouse of metal-lined cubicles-stood a few inches apart laughing and talking on many levels-Blue light played over their bodies∗-   ⊗The most successful method of sense withdrawal is the immersion tank where the subject floats in water at blood temperature, sound and light withdrawn - Loss of body outline, awareness and location of the limbs occurs quickly, giving rise to panic in many American subjects - Subjects frequently report feeling that another body is floating half-in and half-out of the body in the first part - Experiments in sense withdrawal using the immersion tanks have been performed by Doctor Lily in Florida - There is another experimental station in Oklahoma - So after fifteen minutes in the tank these marines scream they are losing outlines and have to be removed - I say put two marines in the tank and see who comes out - Science - Pure science - So put a marine and his girl friend in the tank and see who or what emerges -  *Reference to the orgone accumulators of Doctor Wilhelm Reich- Doctor Reich claims that the basic charge of life is this blue orgone-like electrical charge - Orgones form a sphere around the earth and charge the human machine - He discovered that orgones pass readily through iron but are stopped and absorbed by organic matter - So he constructed metal-lined cubicles with layers of organic material behind the metal - Subjects sit in the cubicles lined with iron and accumulate orgones according to the law of increased returns on which life functions - The orgones produce a prickling sensation frequently associated with erotic stimulation and spontaneous orgasm - Reich insists that orgasm is an electrical discharge - He has attached electrodes to the appropriate connections and charted the orgasm - In consequence of these experiments he was of course expelled from various countries before he took refuge in America and died in a federal penitentiary for suggesting the orgone accumulator be used in Projectors flashed the color writing of Hassan i Sabbah on bodies and metal walls- Opened into amusement gardens-Sex Equilibrists perform on tightropes and balancing chairs-Trapeze acts ejaculate in the air-The Sodomite Tumblers doing cartwheels and whirling dances stuck together like dogs-Boys masturbate from scenic railways-Flower floats in the lagoons and canals-Sex cubicles where the acts performed to music project on the tent ceiling a sky of rhythmic copulation-Vast flicker cylinders and projectors sweep the gardens writing explosive bio-advance to neon-Areas of sandwich booths blue movie parlors and transient hotels under ferris wheels and scenic railways-soft water sounds and frogs from the canals -K9 stood opposite a boy from Norway felt the prickling blue light on his genitals filling with blood touched the other tip and a warm shock went down his spine and he came in spasms of light--Silver writing burst in his brain and went out with a smell of burning metal in empty intersections where boys on roller skates turn slow circles and weeds grow through cracked pavement-  Mexican rolled cigarette the soft blue light deep in his lungs-Mexican hands touching felt his pants slide down in soundless explosion of the throat and a taste of blood-His body twisted-Sleeps naked now-wind and water sounds-Outskirts of the city-shadow areas of sandwich booths and transient hotels under scenic railways-  We drank the beer and ate the smorbrot-I dropped half a sandwich in my lap and she wiped the butter off with a napkin laughing as the cloth bulged under her fingers my back against a tree the sun on my crotch tingling filling with blood she opened my belt and: "Raise up, darling," pulled my pants down to the knee-  We ate the smorbrot with hot chocolate from the thermos bottle and I spilled a cup of chocolate in my lap and jumped up and she wiped the chocolate off with a paper napkin and I dodged away laughing as the cloth bulged under her fingers and she followed me with the napkin and opened my belt-I felt my pants slide down and the sun on my naked crotch tingling and filling with blood-We did it half undressed - When I came there was silver light popped in my eyes like a flash bulb and looking over her shoulder I saw little green men in the trees swinging from branch to branch turning cartwheels in the air-And sex acts by naked acrobats on tightropes and balancing poles-Jissom drifting cobwebs through clear green light-Washed in the stream and pulled up my pants-We rode back to Copenhagen on my motor scooter-I left her in front of her flat block and arranged a meeting for Sunday-As she walked away I could see the grass stains on the back of her dress-That night I was blank and went back to a bar in Neuerhaven where I can usually find a tourist to buy drinks-and sat down at a table with a boy about my age-I noticed he had a very small narrow head tapering from his neck which was thick and smooth and something strange about his eyes-The iris was shiny black like broken coal with pinpoint green pupils-He turned and looks straight at me and I got a feeling like scenic railways in the stomach -Then he ordered two beers-"I see that you are blank," he said-The beers came-"I work with the circus," he said-balancing his chair- "Like this on wires-never with net-In South America I did it over a gorge of a thousand meters in depth."
treating cancer - It has occurred to this investigator that orgone energy can be concentrated to disperse the miasma of idiotic prurience and anxiety that blocks any scientific investigation of sexual phenomenon -Preliminary experiments indicate that certain paintings -like Brion Gysin's -when projected on a subject produced some of the effects observed in orgone accumulators -   Balancing he drank the Tuborg-"There are not many who can see us-Come and I will show you our real acts."
We took a cab to the outskirts of the city-There was a warm electric wind blowing through the car that seemed to leave the ground-We came to what looked like a ruined carnival by a lake-In a tent lit by flickering blue globes I met more boys with the same narrow head and reversed eyes-They passed around a little pipe and I smoked and felt green tingling in my crotch and lips-A Negro drummer began pounding his drum with sticks-The boys got up laughing and passing the pipe and talking in a language like bird calls and took off their clothes-They climbed a ladder to the high wire and walked back and forth like cats-A magic lantern projected color writing on their bodies that looked like Japanese tattooing-They all got erections and arching past each other on the wire genitals touched in a shower of blue sparks-One boy balanced a steel chair on the wire and ejaculated in a crescendo of drum beats and flickering rainbow colors-jissom turning slow cartwheels dissolved in yellow light- Another boy with earphones crackling radio static and blue sparks playing around his yellow hair did a Messerschmidt number-the chair rocking in space-tracer bullets of jissom streaking cross interstellar void-(Naked boys on roller skates turn slow circles at the intersection of ruined suburbs-falling through a maze of penny arcades- spattered the cracked concrete weeds and dog excrement-) The boys came down from the wire and one of them flicked my jacket-I took off my clothes and practiced balancing naked in a chair-The balance point was an electrical field holding him out of gravity-The charge built up in his genitals and he came in a wet dream the chair fluid and part of his body-That night made sex with the boy I met in Neuerhaven for the first time with each other in space -Sure calm of wire acts balanced on ozone- blue electric spasms-Smell of burning metal in the penny arcade I got a hard on looking at the peep show and Hans laughed pointing to my fly: "Let's make the roller coaster," he said-The cashier took our money with calm neutral glance-A young Italian clicked us out- We were the only riders and as soon as the car started we slipped off our shorts-We came together in the first dip as the car started up the other side throwing blood into our genitals tight and precise as motor parts-open shirts flapping over the midway-Silver light popped in my head and went out in blue silence-Smell of ozone-You see sex is an electrical charge that can be turned on and off if you know the electromagnetic switchboard-Sex is an electrical flesh trade-It is usually turned on by water sounds-Now take your sex words on rose wallpaper brass bed-Explode in red brown green from colors to the act on the association line-Naked charge can explode sex words to color's rectal brown green ass language-The sex charge is usually controlled by sex words forming an electromagnetic pattern-This pattern can be shifted by substituting other factors for words-Take a simple sex word like "masturbate'-"jack off'-Substitute color for the words like: "jack"-red "off”-white- red- white-Flash from words to color on the association screen-Associate silently from colors to the act-Substitute other factors for the words-Arab drum music- Musty smell of erections in outhouses-Feel of orgasm -Color-music-smell-feel to the million sex acts all time place-Boys red-white from ferris wheel, scenic railways , bridges, whistling bicycles, tree houses careening freight cars train whistles drifting jissom in winds of Panhandle-shivering through young bodies under boarding house covers rubbly outskirts of South American city ragged pants dropped to cracked bleeding feet black dust blowing through legs and genitals-Pensive lemur smell of erection- cool basement toilets in St. Louis-Summer afternoon on car seats to the thin brown knee-Bleak public school flesh naked for the physical the boy with epilepsy felt The Dream in his head struggling for control locker room smells on his stomach-He was in The Room with many suitcases all open and drawers full of things that had to be packed and only a few minutes to catch the boat whistling in the harbor and more and more drawers and the suitcases won't close arithmetical disorder and the wet dream tension in his crotch-The other boys laughing and pointing in the distance now as he got out of control silver light popped in his eyes and he fell with a sharp metal cry-through legs and genitals felt his pants slide-shivering outskirts of the city-wind of morning in a place full of dust-Naked for a physical orgasms occur-tightening stomach muscles-scenic railways exploded in his crotch-Legs and genitals lost outline careening through dream flesh-smell of the mud flats-warm spurts to sluggish stream water from the tree house-a few inches apart laughing in the sunlight jissom cartwheels in the clear air of masturbating afternoons-pulled up my pants-Explosion of the throat from color to the act jumped up laughing in the transient hotels- careening area of sandwich booths-Silver writing burst in moonlight through a Mexican about twenty shifting his crotch sighed and moved naked now a few inches in his hand-pleasure tingling through cracked bleeding feet With phantom limbs his cock got hard sensations on roller skates- slow intersection of weeds and concrete- Penny arcades spattered light on a Mexican about twenty-Wet dreams of flight sighed in lamp-Flash from word to color sex acts all time place exploded in muscles drifting sheets of male flesh-Boys on wind of morning- first spurts unbuttoned my pants-Area of sandwich booths and intolerable scenic railways he came wet dream way-(In the tree house black ants got into our clothes pulling off shirts and pants and brushing the ants off each other he kept brushing my crotch- "there's an ant there" and jacked me off into the stream of masturbating afternoons)-Hans laughed pointing to my shorts-Pants to the ankle we were the only riders-Wheee came together in the first dip open shorts flapping genitals-Wind of morning through flesh- Outskirts of the city-   Its Accounts  Now hazard flakes fall A huge wave rolled treatment "pay back the red you stole"- Farewell for Alexander-Fading out in Ewyork, Onolulu, Aris, Ome, Oston-Sub editor melted into air-I Sekuin hardly breathe-Dreams are made of might be just what I am look: Prerecorded warning in a woman's voice- Scio is pulling a figure out of logos-A huge wave bowled a married couple off what you could have- Would you permit that person in Ewyork, Onolulu, Aris, Ome, Oston?-One assumes a "beingness" where past crimes highlighted the direction of a "havingness"-He boasted of a long string of other identities-She gave no indication of fundamental agreement We returned to war-Process pre-clear in absurd position for conditions-Scio is like pulling a figure out of The Homicide Act-Logos got Sheraton Call and spent the weekend with a bargain- Venus Vigar choked to passionate weakness-The great wind identity failed-So did art loving Miss West-Every part of your dust yesterday along the High Street Air-The flakes fall that were his cruelest lawyer: show you fear on walls and windows treatment Farewell trouble for Alexander- Pay back the red you stole living or dead from the sky-Hurry up please its accounts-Empty thing police they fading out-Dusk

Try various farewell trouble??
Near curtains for them and trouble shuffled out of the die- Along high street account reaching to my chest-Pay back the red you stole happened-Effects Boys said farewell to Alexander Bargain-"What are we going to do?
Thing police they fading out-Sub editor melted into air-So I had to do Two Of A Kind on toilet paper-Obvious sooner that air strip."
"It was agony to breathe-What might be called the worried in number two intake- Barry going to do?- Partisans of all nations learn all about it-Red Hair we were getting to use on anyone-Pit too-Going to get out of it?"
A colorless question drifted down corridors of that hospital-"I Sekuin-Tell me what you would permit to remain?"

"Sit down young man and smoke .

"Oh yes sir .

"Repeat what you know about Scientology."
"The Scientologists believe sir that words recorded during a period of unconsciousness .

(anesthesia, drunkenness, sleep, childhood amnesia for trauma) .

store pain and that this pain store can be plugged in with key words represented as alternative mathematical formulae indicating number of exposures to the key words and reaction index, the whole battery feeding back from electronic computers .
.
.
They call these words recorded during unconsciousness engrams sir .

.
If I may say so sir the childhood amnesia for trauma is of special interest sir .
.

The child forgets sir but since the controllers have the engram tapes sir any childhood trauma can be plugged in at any time .

The pain that overwhelms that person is known as basic basic sir and when basic basic is wiped off the tape .

Oh sir then that person becomes what they call a clear sir .
