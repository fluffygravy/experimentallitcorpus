Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold.
A wide yellow cummerbund girdles her.
A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her large dark eyes and raven hair!)
BLOOM: Molly!
MARION: Welly?
Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me.
(Satirically) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
BLOOM: (Shifts from foot to foot) No, no.
Not the least little bit.
(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions, hopes, crubeensfor her supper, things to tell her, excuses, desire, spellbound.
A coin gleams on her forehead.
On her feet are jewelled toerings.
Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain.
Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits.
A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah.
He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters.
Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)
MARION: Nebrakada!
Feminimum.
(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel.
Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)
BLOOM: I can give you…I mean as your business menagerer…Mrs Marion…if you…  MARION: So you notice some change?
(Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher.
A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.)
O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud!
Go and see life.
See the wide world.
BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water.
Shop closes early on Thursday.
But the first thing in the morning.
(He pats divers pockets) This moving kidney.
Ah!
(He points to the south, then to the east.
A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume!)
THE SOAP:  We’re a capital couple are Bloom and I;  He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.
(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)
SWENY: Three and a penny, please.
BLOOM: Yes.
For my wife, Mrs Marion.
Special recipe.
MARION: (Softly) Poldy!
BLOOM: Yes, ma’am?
MARION: Ti trema un poco il cuore?
(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni.)
BLOOM: Are you sure about that Voglio’i I mean the  pronunciati…  (He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier.
The elderly  bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering)  THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead.
Fresh thing was never touched.
Fifteen.
There’s no-one in it only her old father that’s dead drunk.
(She points.
In the gap of her dark den furtive, rain-bedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)
BRIDIE: Hatch street.
Any good in your mind?
(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs.
A burly rough pursues with booted strides.
He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom.
Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker?)
THE BAWD: (Her wolf eyes shining) He’s getting his pleasure.
You won’t get a virgin in the flash houses.
Ten shillings.
Don’t be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us.
Sixtyseven is a bitch.
(Leering, Gerty MacDowell limps forward.
She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout)  GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou.
(She murmurs) You did that.
I hate you.
BLOOM: I?
When?
You’re dreaming.
I never saw you.
THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat.
Writing the gentleman false letters.
Streetwalking and soliciting.
Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
GERTY: (TO Bloom) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.
(She paws his sleeve, slobbering) Dirty married man!
I love you for doing that to me.
(She slides away crookedly.
Mrs Breen in man’s frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)
MRS BREEN: Mr…  BLOOM: (Coughs gravely) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant…  MRS BREEN: Mr Bloom!
You down here in the haunts of sin!
I caught you nicely!
Scamp!
BLOOM: (Hurriedly) Not so loud my name.
Whatever do you think me?
Don’t give me away.
Walls have hears.
How do you do?
It’s ages since I. You’re looking splendid.
Absolutely it.
Seasonable weather we are having this time of year.
Black refracts heat.
Short cut home here.
Interesting quarter.
Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum.
I am the secretary…  MRS BREEN: (Holds up a finger) Now don’t tell a big fib!
I know somebody won’t like that.
O just wait till I see Molly!
(Slily) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!
BLOOM: (Looks behind) She often said she’d like to visit.
Slumming.
The exotic, you see.
Negro servants too in livery if she had money.
Othello black brute.
Eugene Stratton.
Even the bones and cornerman at the Liver-more christies.
Bohee brothers.
Sweep for that matter.
(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out.
Each has his banjo slung.
Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twing-twang wires.
Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)
There’s someone in the house with Dina  There’s someone in the house, I know,  There’s someone in the house with Dina  Playing on the old banjo.
(They whisk black masks from raw bobby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)
BLOOM: (With a sour tenderish smile) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined?
Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?
MRS BREEN: (Screams gaily) O, you ruck!
You ought to see yourself!
BLOOM: For old sake’sake.
I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials.
You know I had a soft corner for you.
(Gloomily) ’Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.
MRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show!
Killing simply.
(She puts out her hand inquisitively) What are you hiding behind your back?
Tell us, there’s a dear.
BLOOM: (Seizes her wrist with his free hand) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin.
How time flies by!
Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson’s house-warming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading?
Subject, what is in this snuffbox?
MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part.
You were always a favourite with the ladies.
BLOOM: (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
MRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall.
Love’s old sweet song.
BLOOM: (Meaningfully dropping his voice) I confess I’m teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person’s something is a little teapot at present.
MRS BREEN: (Gushingly) Tremendously teapot!
London’s teapot and I’m simply teapot all over me.
(She rubs sides with him.)
After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman.
Under the mistletoe.
Two is company.
BLOOM: (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber half moon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently) Th witching hour of night.
I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly.
(Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring) Là ci darem la mono.
MRS BREEN: (In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph’s diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly) Voglio e non.
You’re hot!
You’re scalding!
The left hand nearest the heart.
BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast.
I can never forgive you for that.
(His clenched fist at his brow) Think what it means.
All you meant to me then.
(Hoarsely) Woman, it’s breaking me!
(Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely’s sand- wichboard, shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left.
Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter!)
ALF BERGAN: (Points jeering at the sandwich boards)  U. P.: Up.
MRS BREEN: (To Bloom) High jinks below stairs.
(She gives him the glad eye) Why didn’t you kiss the spot to make it well?
You wanted to.
BLOOM: (Shocked) Molly’s best friend!
Could you?
MRS BREEN: (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss) Hnhn.
The answer is a lemon.
Have you a  little present for me there?
BLOOM: (Offhandedly) Kosher.
A snack for supper.
The home without potted meat is incomplete.
I was at Leak.
Mrs Bandman Palmer.
Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare.
Unfortunately threw away the programme.
Rattling good place round there for pig’s feet.
Feel.
(Richie Goulding, three ladies’ hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash.
He opens it and shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon hoddies and tightpacked pills.)
RICHIE: Best value in Dub.
(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)
PAT: (Advances with a tilted disk of spillspilling gravy) Steak and kidney.
Bottle of lager.
Hee hee hee.
Wait till I wait.
RICHIE: Goodgod.
Inev erate inall…(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward.
The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)
RICHIE: (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah!
Bright’s!
Lights!
BLOOM: (Points to the navvy) A spy.
Don’t attract attention.
I hate stupid crowds.
I am not on pleasure bent.
I am in a grave predicament.
MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and bull story.
BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.
But you must never tell.
Not even Molly.
I have a most particular reason.
MRS BREEN: (All agog) O, not for worlds.
BLOOM: Let’s walk on.
Shall us?
MRS BREEN: Let’s.
(The bawd makes an unheeded sign.
Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen.
The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail)  THE BAWD: Jewman’s melt!
BLOOM: (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine  in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd’s plaid Saint Andrew’s cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
MRS BREEN: (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil) Leopardstown.
BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown.
And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose…  MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat!
Don’t tell me!
Nice adviser!
BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
MRS BREEN: (Squeezes his arm, simpers) Naughty cruel I was.
BLOOM: (LOW, secretly, ever more rapidly) And Molly was  eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket.
Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style.
She was…  MRS BREEN:Too…  BLOOM: Yes.
And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me ifl ever heard or read or knew or came across…  MRS BREEN: (Eagerly) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
(She fades from his side.
Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates.
In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily.
Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour.
An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)
THE GAFFER: (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan’s plasterers.
THE LOITERERS: (Guffaw with cleftpalates) O jays!
(Their paintspeckled hats wag.
Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)
BLOOM: Coincidence too.
They think it funny.
Anything but that.
Broad daylight.
Tryingto walk.
Lucky no woman.
THE LOITERERS: Jays, that’s a good one.
Glauber salts.
O jays, into the men’s porter.
(Bloom passes.
Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)
THE WHORES:  Are you going far, queer fellow?
How’s your middle leg?
Got a match on you?
Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond.
From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk.
In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats)  THE NAVVY: (Belching) Where’s the bloody house?
THE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street.
Shilling a bottle of stout.
Respectable woman.
THE NAVVY: (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them) Come on, you British army!
PRIVATE CARR: (Behind his back) He aint half balmy.
PRIVATE COMPTON: (Laughs) What ho!
PRIVATE CARR: (To the navvy) Portobello barracks canteen.
You ask for Carr.
Just Carr.
THE NAVVY: (Shouts)  We are the boys Of Wexford.
PRIVATE COMPTON: Say!
What price the sergeantmajor?
PRIVATE CARR: Bennett?
He’s my pal.
I love old  Bennett.
THE NAVVY: (Shouts)  The galling chain.
And free our native land.
(He staggers forward, dragging them with him.
Bloom stops, at fault.
The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)
BLOOM: Wildgoose chase this.
Disorderly houses.
Lord knows where they are gone.
Drunks cover distance double quick.
Nice mixup.
Scene at Westland row.
Then jump in first class with third ticket.
Then too far.
Train with engine behind.
Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision.
Second drink does it.
Once is a dose.
What am I following him for?
Still, he’s the best of that lot.
If I hadn’t heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn’t have gone and wouldn’t have met.
Kismet.
He’ll lose that cash.
Relieving office here.
Good biz for cheapjacks, organs.
What do ye lack?
Soon got, soon gone.
Might have lost my life too with that mangong-wheel trackt rolley glare juggernaut only for presence of mind.
Can’t always save you, though.
If I had passed Truelock’s window that day two minutes later would have been shot.
Absence of body.
Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds.
What was he?
Kildare street club toff.
God help his gamekeeper.
(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design?)
Odd!
Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown.
What’s that like?
(Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes.
The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths!)
THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets.
Sweets of sin.
BLOOM: My spine’s a bit limp.
Go or turn?
And this food?
Eat it and get all pigsticky.
Absurd I am.
Waste of money.
One and eightpence too much.
(The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail) Strange how they take to me.
Even that brute today.
Better speak to him first.
Like women they like rencontres.
Stinks like a polecat.
Chacun son gout.
He might be mad.
Fido.
Uncertain in his movements.
Good fellow!
Garryowen!
(The wolf dog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out) Influence of his surroundings.
Give and have done with it.
Provided nobody.
(Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher’s tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner.
He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.)
Sizeable for threepence.
But then I have it in my left hand.
Calls for more effort.
Why?
Smaller from want of use.
O, let it slide.
Two and six.
(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide.
The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones.
Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant.
They murmur together)  THE WATCH: Bloom.
Of Bloom.
For Bloom.
Bloom.
(Each lays a hand on Bloom’s shoulder)  FIRST WATCH: Caught in the act.
Commit no nuisance.
BLOOM: (Stammers’) I am doing good to others.
(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks)  THE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake.
BLOOM: The friend of man.
Trained by kindness.
(He points.
Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the munching spaniel)  BOB DORAN: Towser.
Give us the paw.
Give the paw.
(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig’s knuckle between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles.
Bob Doran falls silently into an area)  SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.
BLOOM: (Enthusiastically) A noble work!
I scolded that tramdriver on Harold’s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab.
Bad French I got for my pains.
Of course it was frosty and the last tram.
All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
(Signer Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer’s costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging boarhound)  SIGNOR MAFFEI: (With a sinister smile) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound.
It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores.
Lash under the belly with a knotted thong.
Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater.
A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena.
(He glares) I possess the Indian sign.
The glint of my eye does it with these breast-sparklers.
(With a bewitching smile) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.
FIRST WATCH: Come.
Name and address.
BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment.
Ah, yes!
(He takes off his high grade hat, saluting) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon.
You have heard of von Bloom Pasha.
Umpteen millions.
Donnerwetter!
Owns half Austria.
Egypt.
Cousin.
FIRST WATCH: Proof.
(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom’s hat)  BLOOM: (In red fez, cadi’s dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it) Allow me.
My club is the Junior Army and Navy.
SOLICITORS: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor’s Walk.
FIRST WATCH: (Reads) Henry Flower.
No fixed abode.
Unlawfully watching and besetting.
SECOND WATCH: An alibi.
You are cautioned.
BLOOM: (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower) This is the flower in question.
It was given me by a man I don’t know his name.
(Plausibly) You know that old joke, rose of Castille.
Bloom.
The change of name Virag.
(He murmurs privately and confidentially) We are engaged you see, sergeant.
Lady in the case.
Love entanglement.
(He shoulders the second watch gently) Dash it all.
It’s a way we gallants have in the navy.
Uniform that does it.
(He turns gravely to the first watch) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes.
Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy.
(To the second watch gaily) I’ll introduce you, inspector.
She’s game.
Do it in shake of a lamb’s tail.
(A dark mercurialised face appears leading a veiled figure.)
