The wind!
Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child.
With a high ro!
and a randy ro!
and my galloping tearing tandy O!
Bow to the inevitable.
Grin and bear it.
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B. Murphy.
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:  —You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?
The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.
—Thank you, the sailor said.
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:  —We come up this morning eleven o’clock.
The three-master Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.
I shipped to get over.
Paid off this afternoon.
There’s my discharge.
See?
W. B. Murphy, A.
B. S.  In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very cleanlooking folded document.
—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.
—Why, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.
I was in the Red Sea.
I was in China and North America and South America.
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.
I seen Russia.
Gospodi pomlooy.
That’s how the Russians prays.
—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.
—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen queer things too, ups and downs.
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously.
—Khaan!
Like that.
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.
Look here.
Here they are.
A friend of mine sent me.
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table.
The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios.
Bern, Bolivia.
All focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
—Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added.
Stomachs like breadgraters.
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children.
See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw.
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.
—Know how to keep them off?
he inquired genially.
Nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saving:  —Glass.
That boggles ‘em.
Glass.
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.
It ran as follows: Tarjeta Posted.
Senor A. Boudin, Galena Becche, Santiago, Chile.
There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t.
somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back.
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with.
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and nrstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C. P. M‘Coy type—lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket.
No, something top notch, an all star Irish cast, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with its own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.
But who?
That was the rub.
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.
A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e.
Brown, Robinson and Co.
It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife.
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs, even, Poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal, where if report spoke true, the coup dœilwas exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar.
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.
Interesting to fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or vice-versa or the two sides in fact.
He turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to Stephen.
—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and every pill was something different.
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the Chinese does.
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures.
—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.
Knife in his back.
Knife like that.
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking claspknife, quite in keeping with his character, and held it in the striking position.
—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.
Like that.
Prepare to meet your God, says he.
Chuck!
It went into his back up to the butt.
His heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.
That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto.
After which harrowing dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.
—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.
At this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.
His inscrutable face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.
Funny very.
There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.
One man was reading by fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives choza de; another, the seaman’s discharge.
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years previously, in the days of die land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking] early in the eighties, eiehtyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.
—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.
Give us back them papers.
The request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.
—Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar?
Mr Bloom inquired.
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.
—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.
—What year would that be about?
Mr. Bloom interpolated.
Can you recall the boats?
Our soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before answering.
—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.
Salt junk all the time.
Tired, seemingly, he ceased.
His questioner, perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe.
Suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant, to rule the waves.
On more than one occasion—a dozen at the lowest—near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.
And it left him wondering why.
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under —well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.
Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance, which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason, if no other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that, should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on, and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.
—There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded.
Went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month.
Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.
I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup.
I hate roaming about.
There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.
—What age is he?
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.
—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance.
My son Danny?
He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.
—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked.
Sure as nuts.
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.
It’s them black lads I objects to.
I hate those buggers.
Sucks your blood dry, they does.
Seeing they were all looking at his chest, he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.
—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.
Fellow the name of Antonio done that.
There he is himself, a Greek.
—Did it hurt much doing it?
one asked the sailor.
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his.
Squeezing or…  —See here, he said, showing Antonio.
There he is, cursing the mate.
And there he is now, he added.
The same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat who this time stretched over.
—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.
He’s gone too.
Ate by sharks after.
Ay, ay.
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.
—Neat bit of work, longshoreman one said.
—And what’s the number for?
loafer number two queried.
—Eaten alive?
a third asked the sailor.
—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the direction of the questioner about the number.
A Greek he was.
And then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end:  —As bad as old Antonio,  For he left me on my ownio.
The face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat, peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm, and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink?
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.
), and begged the chance of his washing.
Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?
Your washing.
Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holies Street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say.
Love me, love my dirty shirt.
Still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.
Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.
—The gunboat, the keeper said.
—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.
Unfortunate creature!
Of course, I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.
Still no matter what the cause is from…  Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:  —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.
She is a bad merchant.
She buys dear and sells cheap.
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanler to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any old-maidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully state he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.
Whoever embarked on a policy of that sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.
—You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup?
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.
Do you?
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:  —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptioper accidens both being excluded by court etiquette.
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:  —Simple?
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word.
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Rontgen did, or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean.
The same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
—O, that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the best known passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.
On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.
—Has been?
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point.
I’m not so sure about that.
That’s a matter of every man’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there.
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them, like Hamlet and Bacon, as you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.
Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way?
Let me stir it and take a piece of that bun.
It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised.
Still, no one can give what he hasn’t got.
Try a bit.
—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work.
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good.
Shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings, and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.
On the other hand, he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her piano-playing.
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.
Sulphate of copper poison, SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where.
Anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibbie’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.
—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle—it clopped out of it when taken up—by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.
—Still, it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.
You ought to eat more solid food.
You would feel a different man.
—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.
But oblige me by taking away that knife.
I can’t look at the point of it.
It reminds me of Roman history.
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.
—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to his confidente sotto voce.
Do you think they are genuine?
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.
Look at him.
Yet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up, ever since he clapped eyes on him.
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.
He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera.
And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.
—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.
Giants, though, that is rather a far cry you see once in a way.
Marcella, the midget queen.
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged.
They couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.
There’s an example again of simple souls.
However, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.
On the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he was none the less free to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way, not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth, over in little Italy there, near the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.
—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they carry in lie abdomen.
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half, that is.
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e.
Gibraltar.
She has the Spanish type.
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.
I, for one, certainly believe climate accounts for character.
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.
—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.
Roberto ruba roba sua.
—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.
—Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari, he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.
—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.
All are washed in the blood of the sun.
Coincidence, I just happened to be in the Kildare street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.
You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here.
An exception here and there.
Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what I’m talking about is the female form.
Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say.
Rumpled stockings—it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see.
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.
Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say.
He had doubled die Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck of Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque— nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it, Palme, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times) breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.
Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady Cairns of Swansea, run into by the Mona, which was on an opposite tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.
No aid was given.
Her master, the Mona’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.
At this stage an incident happened.
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.
—Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour, who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.
He made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.
While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself close at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently woke a horse of the cabrank.
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke, the watcher of the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability, from dictates of humanity, knowing him before—shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms of Morpheus.
A truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £100 a year at one time which of course the double-barrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver.
He drank, needless to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.
All, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch that year.
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.
There were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently aufait.
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted by a MrWorthing-ton or some name like that, eh?
Ask her captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British Government gave him for that day’s work.
Captain John Lever of the Lever line.
—Am I right, skipper?
he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and die rest of his exertions.
That worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words, growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation—cum—potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:  —The biscuits was as hard as brass,  And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.
O Johnny Lever!
Johnny Lever, O !
After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds’ worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Cavan growing tobacco.
Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon?
But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice—thoroughly monopolising all the conversation—was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed.
The Boers were the beginning of the end.
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero—a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.
Silence all round marked the termination of ins finale.
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.
—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.
To which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.
—Who’s the best troops in the army?
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.
And the best jumpers and racers?
And the best admirals and generals we’ve got?
Tell me that.
—The Irish for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.
—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.
The Irish catholic peasant.
He’s the backbone of our empire.
You know Jem Mullins?
While allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.
Then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries, even though poles apart.
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.
And now, why?
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game.
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (Bloom) couldn’t help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence—or king’s now—like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.
Quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south—have her or swing for her—when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (the man having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.
Like actresses, always farewell—positively last performance then come up smiling again.
Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.
s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on.
Then as for the others, he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.
—He took umbrage at something or other, that much-injured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.
He called me a jew, and in a heated fashion, offensively.
So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in reality I’m not.
That was one for him.
A soft answer turns away wrath.
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.
Am I not right?
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly…  —Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, Ckristus or Bloom his name is, or, after all, any other, secundum content.
—Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.
But with a little goodwill all round.
It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality?
I resent violence or intolerance in any shape or form.
It never reaches anything or stops anything.
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.
—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.
—Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.
—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely…  All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood—bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag—were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.
—They accuse—remarked he audibly.
He turned away from the others, who probably…and spoke nearer to, so as the others…in case they…  —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining.
Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.
History—would you be surprised to learn?— proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects, has much to answer for, imported them.
Why?
Because they are practical and are proved to be so.
I don’t want to indulge in any…because you know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are…But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty.
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.
Turks, it’s in the dogma.
Because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better—at least, so I think.
That’s the juggle on which the p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences.
I’m, he resumed, with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes fro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £300 per annum.
That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.
At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth.
I call that patriotism.
Ubi patria, as we learned a small smattering of in our classical day in Alma Mater, vita bene.
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.
Over his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning, burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said—if you work.
—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning to work.
The eyes were surprised at this observation, because as he, the person who owned them pro.
tem.
observed, or rather, his voice speaking did: All must work, have to, together.
—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.
Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the thing.
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.
That’s work too.
Important work.
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your ph ilosophy as the peasant has.
What?
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.
Each is equally important.
