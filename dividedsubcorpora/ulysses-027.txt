Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.
Gaming at Daly’s.
No card-sharping then.
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.
Somewhere here Lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.
Stables behind Moira house.
Damn good gin that was.
Fine dashing young nobleman.
Good stock, of course.
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves, gave him away.
Course they were on the wrong side.
They rose in dark and evil days.
Fine poem that is: Ingram.
They were gentlemen.
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.
Masterly rendition.
At the siege of Ross did my father fall.
A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.
Frockcoats.
Cream sunshades.
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.
His Excellency!
Too bad!
Just missed that by a hair.
Damn it!
What a pity!
Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s fingers prove a timedulled chain.
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil lights shining in the darkness.
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.
She dances in a foul gloom where gum burns with garlic.
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.
A long and seafed silent rut.
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard.
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth!
The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes.
A lore of drugs.
Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny  trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded umbrella, one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.
Beingless beings.
Stop!
Throb always without you and the throb always within.
Your heart you sing of.
I between them.
Where?
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both.
But stun myself too in the blow.
Shatter me you who can.
Bawd and butcher, were the words.
I say!
Not yet awhile.
A look around.
Yes, quite true.
Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time.
You say right, sir.
A Monday morning, ‘twas so, indeed.
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.
In Clohissey’s window a faded i860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.
The heavyweights in light loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.
And they are throbbing: heroes’ hearts.
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.
—Twopence each, the huckster said.
Four for sixpence.
Tattered pages.
The Irish Beekeeper.
Life and Miracles of the Cure of Ars.
Pocket Guide to Killarney.
I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes.
Stephana Dedalo, alumno optima, palmam ferenti.
Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.
Binding too good probably, what is this?
Eighth and ninth book of Moses.
Secret of all secrets.
Seal of King    David.
Thumbed pages: read and read.
Who has passed here before me?
How to soften chapped hands.
Recipe for white wine vinegar.
How to win a woman’s love.
For me this.
Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:  —Se el yilo nebrakada femininum!
Amor me solo!
Sanktus !
Amen.
Who wrote this?
Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged.
As good as any other abbot’s charms, as mumbling Joachim’s.
Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your wool.
—What are you doing here, Stephen.
Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.
Shut the book quick.
Don’t let see.
—What are you doing?
Stephen said.
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.
I told her of Paris.
Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token.
Nebrakada femininum.
—What have you there?
Stephen asked.
—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.
Is it any good?
My eyes they say she has.
Do others see me so?
Quick, far and daring.
Shadow of my mind.
He took the coverless book from her hand.
Chardenal’s French primer.
—What did you buy that for?
he asked.
To learn French?
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.
Show no surprise.
Quite natural.
—Here, Stephen said.
It’s all right.
Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.
I suppose all my books are gone.
—Some, Dilly said.
We had to.
She is drowning.
Agenbite.
Save her.
Agenbite.
All against us.
She will drown me with her, eyes and hair.
Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul.
Salt green death.
We.
Agenbite of inwit.
Inwit’s agenbite.
Misery!
Misery!
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.
How are things?
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s.
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.
—What’s the best news?
Mr Dedalus said.
—Why then not much, Father Cowley said.
I’m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.
—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.
Who is it?
—O, Father Cowley said.
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.
—With a broken back, is it?
Mr Dedalus asked.
—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.
Reuben of that ilk.
I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard.
He’s going to say a word to Long John to get him to take those two men off.
All I want is a little time.
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.
—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.
Poor old bockedy Ben!
He’s always doing a good turn for someone.
Hold hard!
He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.
Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:  —Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.
—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure.
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:  —That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?
—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
He stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:  —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.
—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.
Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet.
—And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin?
Father Cowley asked.
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glasseyed, strode past the Kildare street club.
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note.
—Aw!
he said.
—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.
—What about that?
Ben Dollard said.
Not too dusty?
What?
He turned to both.
—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.
The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old Chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiersj attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the Ford of Hurdles.
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shop-fronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.
—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said.
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.
He’s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.
He’s well worth seeing, mind you.
Come along.
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t…wait awhile…We’re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.
—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.
—What few days?
he boomed.
Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?
—He has, Father Cowley said.
—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said.
The landlord has the prior claim.
I gave him all the particulars.
29 Windsor avenue.
Love is the name?
—That’s right, Father Cowley said.
The reverend Mr Love.
He’s a minister in the country somewhere.
But are you sure of that?
—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.
He led Father Cowley boldly forward linked to his bulk.
—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.
—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.
The policeman touched his forehead.
—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.
—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.
—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.
—Boyd?
Martin Cunningham said shortly.
Touch me not.
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.
—Look here Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office.
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.
—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.
And put down the five shillings too.
—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.
—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.
—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted elegantly.
They went down Parliament street.
—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.
—Righto, Martin Cunningham said.
Here goes.
Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.
—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms.
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.
—And Long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.
The tall form of Long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.
—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.
Long John Fanning made no way for them.
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.
—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?
he said, with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.
And old Barlow the mace-bearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him.
Damned Irish language, of our forefathers.
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his  Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.
—What Dignam was that?
Long John Fanning asked.
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.
—O, my corns!
he said plaintively.
Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere.
Uff!
Ooo!
Mind!
Testily he made room for himself beside Long John Farming’s flank and passed in and up the stairs.
—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff.
I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.
—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of Long John Fanning ascending towards Long John Fanning in the mirror.
—Rather lowsized, Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.
Long John Fanning could not remember him.
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.
—What’s that?
Martin Cunningham said.
All turned where they stood; John Wyse Nolan came down again.
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.
—What was it?
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.
—The lord lieutenant general and general governor of Ireland.
John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his panama to Haines.
—Parnell’s brother.
There in the corner.
They chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
—Is that he?
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
—Yes, Mulligan said.
That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.
—I’ll take a mélange, Haines said to the waitress.
—Two mélanges, Buck Mulligan said.
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.
When she had gone he said, laughing:    —We call it D. B. C. because they have damn bad cakes.
O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.
Haines opened his newbought book.
—I’m sorry, he said.
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground.
of all minds that have lost their balance.
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:  —England expects…  Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.
—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.
Wandering Ængus I call him.
—I am sure he has an idée fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.
Such persons always have.
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.
He will never capture the Attic note.
The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth.
That is his tragedy.
He can never be a poet.
The joy of creation…  —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.
I see.
I tackled him this morning on belief.
There was something on his mind, I saw.
It’s rather interesting because Professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.
Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.
He helped her to unload her tray.
—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.
Does he write anything for your movement?
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.
He is going to write something in ten years.
—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.
—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.
I don’t want to be imposed on.
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.
Almidano Artifoni walked past Holies street, past Sewell’s yard.
Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.
Distantly behind him a bund strippling tapped his way by the wall of College Park.
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.
At the corner of Wilde’s he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan Hall, frowned at    the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn.
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.
With ratsteeth bared he muttered:  —Coactus volui.
He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.
As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.
—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are!
You’re blinder nor I am, you bitch’s bastard!
Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruit cake jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, court dress milliner, stopped him.
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props.
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.
Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns, God, that’d be a good pucking match to see.
Myler Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.
Two bar    entrance, soldiers half price.
I could easy do a bunk on ma.
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.
That’s me in mourning.
When is it?
May the twenty-second.
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.
No Sandymount tram.
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.
He met schoolboys with satchels.
I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.
He met other schoolboys.
Do they notice I’m in mourning?
Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.
Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name.
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.
How was that?
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.
Never see him again.
Death, that is.
Fa is dead.
My father is dead.
He told me to be a good son to ma.
I couldn’t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.
Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father.
