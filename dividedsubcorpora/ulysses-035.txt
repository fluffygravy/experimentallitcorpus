That’s a straw.
Declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O’Ciarnain’s in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.
The venerable president of this noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers.
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M‘Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and power handed down to us from ancient ages.
L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.
The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to die greatest advantage in the time-honoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enchanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience amongst which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.
The proceedings then terminated.

—Talking about violent exercise, sap Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?
—No, says Joe.
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it,  —Who?
Blazes?
says Joe.
And says Bloom:  —What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training of the eye.
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf.
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run the odds and he swatting all the time.
—We know him, says the citizen.
The traitor’s son.
We know what put English gold in his pocket.
—True for you, says Joe.
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:  —Now don’t you think, Bergan?
—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind.
Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.
The welterweight ser-geantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.
The soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw.
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.
The men came to handigrips.
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and, when the bell went, came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat.
It was a knockout clean and clever.
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.
—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.
I hear he’s running a concert tour now up in the north.
—He is, says Joe.
Isn’t he?
—Who?
says Bloom.
Ah, yes.
That’s quite true.
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.
Just a holiday.
—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she?
says Joe.
—My wife?
says Bloom.
She’s singing, yes.
I think it will be a success too.
He’s an excellent man to organise.
Excellent.
Hoho begob, says I to myself, says I.
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest.
Blazes doing the tootle on the flute.
Concert tour.
Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers.
Old Whatwhat.
I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan.
You what?
The water rate, Mr Boylan.
You whatwhat?
That’s the bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip.
’Twixt me and you Caddereesh.
Pride of Calpe’s rocky mount, die ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy.
There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air.
The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.
The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.
And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloys, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.
—Hello, Ned.
—Hello, Alf.
—Hello, Jack.
—Hello, Joe.
—God save you, says the citizen.
—Save you kindly, says J. J. What’ll it be, Ned?
—Half one, says Ned.
So J. J. ordered the drinks.
—Were you round at the court?
says Joe.
—Yes, says J. J. He’ll square that, Ned, says he.
—Hope so, says Ned.
Now what were those two at?
J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile.
With his name in Stubbs’s.
Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, drinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.
Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop.
What’s your name, sir?
Dunne, says he.
Ay, and done, says I. Gob, ye’ll come home by weeping cross one of these days, I’m thinking.
—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there, says Alf.
U. p. up.
—Yes, says J. J.
Looking for a private detective.
—Ay, says Ned, and he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.
—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf laughing.
God I’d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.
—Was it you did it, Alf?
says Joe.
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but die truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.
—Me?
says Alf.
Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.
—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.
—Of course an action would lie, says J. J.
It implies that he is not compos mentis.
U. p. up.
—Compos your eye!
says Alf, laughing.
Do you know that he’s balmy?
Look at his head.
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn?
—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.
—Ha, ha, Alf, says Joe.
—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
—Pity about her, says the citizen.
Or any other woman marries a half and half.
—How half and half?
says Bloom.
Do you mean he…  —Half and half I mean, says the citizen.
A fellow that’s neither fish nor flesh.
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.
—That what’s I mean, says the citizen.
A pishogue, if you know what that is.
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.
And Bloom explained he meant, on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody poverty-stricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pew opener to the pope.
Picture of him on the wall with his smashall Sweeney’s moustaches.
The signor Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.
And who was he, tell us?
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.
—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication.
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the test-case Sadgrove v. Hole.
In my opinion an action might lie.
Six and eightpence, please.
Who wants your opinion?
Let us drink our pints in peace.
Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.
—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.
—Good health, Ned, says J. J.
—There he is again, says Joe.
—Where?
says Alf.
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.
—How did that Canada swindle case go off?
says Joe.
—Remanded, says J. J.
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.
What?
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Course it was a bloody barney.
What?
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.
J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.
—Who tried the case?
says Joe.
—Recorder, says Ned.
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench.
—Ay, says Alf.
Reuben J. was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones for the corporation there near Butt bridge.
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:  —A most scandalous thing!
This poor hardworking man!
How many children?
Ten, did you say?
—Yes, your worship.
And my wife has tie typhoid!
—And a wife with typhoid fever!
Scandalous!
Leave the court immediately, sir.
No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment.
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order!
A poor hardworking industrious man!
I dismiss the case.
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claims of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.
And he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliv-rance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the books.
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.
—Because you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.
That’s the whole secret.
—Rely on me, says Joe.
—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.
We want no more strangers in our house.
—O I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.
It’s just that Keyes you see.
—Consider that done, says Joe.
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.
—The strangers, says the citizen.
Our own fault.
We let them come in.
We brought them.
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.
—Decree nisi, says J. J.
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.
—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes.
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.
—Give us a squint at her, says I.
And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher.
Secrets for enlarging your private parts.
Misconduct of society belle.
Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.
Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself and her fancy man feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.
—O Jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
—There’s hair, Joe, says I.
Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.
—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?
What did those tinkers in the tityhall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?
O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.
—It’s on the march, says the citizen.
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.
So J. J. puts in a word doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and bunking facts and the Nelson policy putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.
To hell with them!
The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets!
No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.
Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.
—The European family, says J. J…  —They’re not European, says the citizen.
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.
You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d’aisance.
And says John Wyse:  —Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:  —Conspuez les Anglais !
Perfide Albion !
He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.
—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan.
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.
—Gold cup, says he.
—Who won, Mr Lenehan?
says Terry.
—Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one.
A rank outsider.
And the rest nowhere.
—And Bass’s mare?
says Terry.
—Still running, says he.
We’re all in a cart.
Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me.
Lord Howard de Walden’s.
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan.
Such is life in an outhouse.
Throwaway, says he.
Takes the biscuit and talking about bunions.
Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.
So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up.
Old mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.
—Not there, my child, says he.
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe.
She’d have won the money only for the other dog.
And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.
—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’t see the beam in their own.
—Raimeis, says the citizen.
There’s no-one as blind as the fellow that won’t see, if you know what that means.
Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes?
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!
And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world!
Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen?
Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis.
Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our far-famed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters.
What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths?
And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption.
—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.
Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast.
I was reading a report of lord Castletown’s…  —Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.
Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.
—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
The fashionable international world attended en masse this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O. Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.
The bride who was given away by her father, the M‘Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service.
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.
We had our trade with Spain and die French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.
—And will again, says Joe.
—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.
And he took the last swig out of the pint, Moya.
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.
Cows in Connacht have long horns.
As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.
—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.
What will you have?
—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.
Terry!
Are you asleep?
—Yes, sir, says Terry.
Small whisky and bottle of All-sop.
Right, sir.
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public.
Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate.
And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo strung up on a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him.
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?
—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.
Hell upon earth it is.
Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.
A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protes-tant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.
And says John Wyse:  —’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meik murder.
—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.
That’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.
—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.
—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.
—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere?
I mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force?
Didn’t I tell you?
As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.
—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen.
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.
They were driven out of house and home in the black 47.
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.
Even the grand Turk sent us his piastres.
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.
—Perfectly true, says Bloom.
But my point was…  —We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.
—Ay, says John Wyse.
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.
Remember Limerick and the broken treaty-stone.
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.
Fontenoy, eh?
And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.
But what did we ever get for it?
—The French!
says the citizen.
Set of dancing masters !
Do you know what it is?
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.
Aren’t they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with perfidious Albion?
Firebrands of Europe and they always were?
