Non coerced maximo, contineri minimo, divinum est.
-----
(Not to be confined by the greatest, yet to be contained within  the smallest, is divine.)
-----
I would be glad if I could promise this book the affection of the  German people.
-----
But I fear that some of them will read it as a  treatise and be too gready concerned with the fabula docet, whereas others will take it too lightly, and that neither the former nor the  latter will understand it.
-----
He who merely inhales the scent of my plant does not know it,  and he who plucks it merely in order to learn from it does not know  it either.
-----
The resolution of dissonances in a particular character is neither  for mere reflection nor for empty pleasure.
-----
The scene of the events which follow is not new, and I confess that  I was once childish enough to try to alter the book in this respect,  but I soon became convinced that it was the only scene appropriate      to Hyperion's elegiac character and was ashamed that the presumable verdict of the public had rendered me so excessively pliable.
-----
I regret that for the present it is not possible for everyone to judge  of the plan of the book.
-----
But the second volume will follow as soon as  possible.
-----
Book One  Hyperion to Bellarmin  Once again the dear earth of my native country brings me joy and  sorrow.
-----
Now every morning I am on the heights of the Corinthian Isthmus; and often, like a bee among flowers, my soul flies back and forth between die seas that, to left and right, cool the feet of my  glowing mountains.
-----
One of the two gulfs would have delighted me especially, had I  stood here a thousand years ago.
-----
Then, surging on like a conquering demigod between the beautiful wilderness of Helicon and Parnassus where the red dawn plays among a hundred snow-covered peaks, and the paradisal plain of  Sicyon, the shining gulf undulated toward the city of joy, youthful  Corinth, pouring out the captured wealth of every region before its  favorite.
-----
But what is that to me?
-----
The cry of the jackal, changing his wild  threnody amid the rubble of Antiquity, startles me from my dreams.
-----
Fortunate the man whose native country flourishes to rejoice and  strengthen his heart!
-----
For me, it is as if I were cast into a swamp, as if  the coffin lid were being nailed shut over me, if anyone reminds me  of mine, and whenever I hear myself called a Greek, it is as if I were  being bound with a dog collar.
-----
And see, my Bellarmin, often when such a remark escaped me,  and perhaps anger brought a tear to my eye, too, the knowing  gentlemen who so much enjoy raising their voices among you Germans, and for whom a grieving heart makes the perfect opportunity to drag out their old sayings, yes, they were in their element, they  presumed to tell me: "Do not complain, act!"
-----
Oh that I had never acted!
-----
By how many hopes should I be the  richer!—  Yes, only forget that there are men, O famished, beleaguered,  infinitely troubled heart!
-----
and return to the place from which you  came, to the arms of Nature, the changeless, the quiet, the beautiful.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  I have nothing of which I may say that it is mine.
-----
Distant and dead are my loved ones, and no voice brings me news  of them anymore.
-----
My business on earth is over.
-----
I set to work full of determination, I  gave my blood to it, and made the world not a penny the richer.
-----
Unknown and alone, I have returned to wander through my native  country, which lies about me like a vast graveyard; and perhaps what  awaits me is the knife of the hunter who preserves us Greeks for his  sport even as he does the wild beasts erf the forest.
-----
Yet still do you shine, Sun of Heaven!
-----
Still do you grow green,  sacred Earth!
-----
Still the rivers roar to the sea, and shady trees rustle  under the noon erf day.
-----
Spring's song erf bliss sings my mortal  thoughts to sleep.
-----
The fullness of the living universe feeds and  satisfies my starving being with its intoxication.
-----
O Blessed Nature!
-----
I know not how it is with me when I raise my  eyes to your beauty, but all the joy of Heaven is in the tears that I  weep in your presence, beloved of beloveds!
-----
My whole being falls silent and listens when the delicate swell of  the breeze plays over my breast.
-----
Often, lost in the wide blue, I look  up into the ether and down into the sacred sea, and I feel as if a,  kindred spirit were opening its arms to me, as if the pain of solitude  were dissolved in the life of the Divinity.
-----
To be one with all—this is the life divine, this is/tnan's heaven.
-----
To be one with all that lives, to return in blessed self-forgetfulness  into the All of Nature—this is the pinnacle of thoughts and joys, this  the sacred mountain peak, the place of eternal rest, where the  noonday loses its oppressive heat and the thunder its voice and the  boiling sea is as the heaving field of grain.
-----
To be one with all that lives!
-----
At those words Virtue puts off her      wrathful armor, the mind of man lays its scepter down, and all  thoughts vanish before the image of the world in its eternal oneness,  even as the striving artist's rules vanish before his Urania, and iron  Fate renounces her dominion, and Death vanishes from the confederacy of beings, and indivisibility and eternal youth bless and beautify the world.
-----
On this height I often stand, my Bellarmin!
-----
But an instant of  reflection hurls me down.
-----
I reflect, and find myself as I was before—  alone, with all the griefs of mortality, and my heart's refuge, the  world in its eternal oneness, is gone; Nature closes her arms, and I  stand like an alien before her and do not understand her.
-----
O!
-----
had I never gone to your schools!
-----
The knowledge which I  pursued down its tunnels and galleries, from which, in my youthful  folly, I expected confirmation of all my pure joy—that knowledge  has corrupted everything for me.
-----
Among you I became so truly reasonable, learned so thoroughly  to distinguish myself from what surrounds me, that now I am  solitary in the beautiful world, an outcast from the garden of  Nature, in which I grew and flowered, and am drying up under the  noonday sun.
-----
Oh, man is a god when he dreams, a beggar when he thinks; and  when inspiration is gone, he stands, like a worthless son whom his  father has driven out of the house, and stares at the miserable  pennies that pity has given him for the road.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  I thank you for asking me to tell you of myself, for making me  remember earlier days.
-----
What sent me back to Greece was wishing to live nearer to the  places where I had played in my youth.
-----
As the laborer into refreshing sleep» so my beleaguered being  often sinks into the arms of the innocent past.
-----
Peace of childhood!
-----
heavenly peace!
-----
how often do I pause before  you in loving contemplation, and try to conceive of you!
-----
But our  concepts are only of what has degenerated and been repaired; of  childhood, of innocence we have no concept.
-----
When I was still a child and at peace, knowing nothing of all that  is about us, was I not then more than now I am, after all my trouble  of heart and all my thinking and struggling?
-----
Yes, divine is the being of the child, so long as it has not been  dipped in the chameleon colors of men.
-----
The child is wholly what it is, and that is why it is so beautiful.
-----
The pressure of Law and Fate touches it not; only in the child is  freedom.
-----
In the child is peace; it has not yet come to be at odds with itselt  Wealth is in the child; it knows not its heart nor the inadequacy of  life.
-----
It is immortal, for it has not heard of death.
-----
But this men cannot bear.
-----
The divine must become like one of  them, must learn that they, too, are there; and before Nature drives  it out of its paradise, men entice and draw it out into the field of the  curse, so that, like them, it shall drudge its life away in the sweat of  its brow.
-----
But the time of awakening is beautiful, too, if only we are not  awakened unseasonably.
-----
Oh, they are sacred days, in which our heart first tries its wings, in  which, bursting with swift, fiery growth, we stand in the glorious  world, like the young plant when it opens to the morning sun and  stretches its tiny arms toward the infinite sky.
-----
How was I driven then to the mountains, to the seashore!
-----
O, how  often I sat with throbbing heart on the heights of Una and watched  the falcons and the cranes, and the bold, rejoicing ships as they  vanished below the horizon!
-----
"There," I thought, "there beyond the horizon you too will one day wander"; and I felt as the man dying of  thirst feels when he flings himself into the cooling current and  splashes the foaming water over his face.
-----
Sobbing I would turn and go home then.
-----
"If only," I often  thought, "my school years were over!"
-----
Innocent boy!
-----
They are still far from over.
-----
That in his youth a man thinks the goal is so near!
-----
It is the most  beautiful of all the illusions with which Nature supports the weakness of our being.
-----
And often, when I lay there among the flowers, basking in the  delicate spring light, and looked up into the serene blue that embraced the warm earth, when I sat under the elms and willows on    6 • Friedrieb Hölderlin  the side of the mountain, after a refreshing rain, when the branches  were yet astir from the touch of the sky and golden clouds moved  over die dripping woods; or when the evening star, breathing the  spirit of peace, rose with the age-old youths and the other heroes of  the sky, and I saw how the life in them moved on through the ether  in eternal, effortless order, and the peace of the world surrounded  and rejoiced me, so that I was suddenly alert and listening, yet did  not know what was befalling me—"Do you love me, dear Father in  Heaven," I whispered, and felt his answer so certainly and so  blissfully in my heart.
-----
O you to whom I cried, as if you were above the stars, whom I  named Maker of Heaven and Earth, kindly idol of my childhood, do  not be angry that I forgot you!—Why is the world not poor enough  to make us seek Another outside of it?
-----
*  Oh, if glorious Nature is the daughter of a Father, is not the  daughter's heart his heart?
-----
Her inmost being, is it not He?
-----
But then,  do I possess it?
-----
do I know it?
-----
It is as if I saw, but afterward I am filled with fear again, as if what  I saw had been my own shape; it is as if I felt it, the Spirit of the  World, like a friend's warm hand, but I awake and realize that I was  holding my own finger.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Do you know how Plato and his Stella loved each other?
-----
So I loved, so was I loved.
-----
Oh, I was a fortunate boy!
-----
It is pleasant when like and like meet in friendship; but it is divine  when a great man draws lesser men up to him.
-----
A gracious word from a valiant heart, a smile under which the  searing glory of the spirit hides itself, is little and is much, is like a  magical password that conceals death and life in its simple syllable,  is like living water that comes welling from the inmost recesses of the  *It is scarcely necessary to say that no one can justly take offense at such expressions, which are no more than manifestations of a state of mind.
-----
(Hölderlin^  note.)
-----
mountains, imparting the secret strength of the earth to us in each of  its crystal drops.
-----
How I hate all the barbarians who imagine that they are wise  because there is no more heart left in them!
-----
all the self-important  monstrosities who slay and desecrate beautiful youth a thousand  times over with their petty, meaningless discipline!
-----
God in heaven!
-----
this is owls undertaking to drive eaglets from the  nest and show them the way to the sun!
-----
Forgive me, spirit of my Adamas, for mentioning these creatures  before I speak of you.
-----
That is all the profit that we gain from  experience—to be able to think of nothing excellent without thinking of its distorted opposite.
-----
Oh!
-----
if only you were ever before me, with all that is akin to you,  grieving demigod of whom I fondly think!
-----
He whom you, O warrior  and champion, enfold in your stillness and strength, he whom you  encounter with your love and wisdom—let him either run away or  become like you!
-----
Meanness and weakness cannot survive beside  you.
-----
How often you were close to me when you were far from me and  long had been, how often you illumined me with your light, warmed  me so that my numbed heart moved again, like the frozen spring  when heaven's ray touches it!
-----
Oh, how I wished I could flee to the  stars with my happiness, that it might not be debased by what was  around me!
-----
I had grown up like a grapevine without a prop» and the wild  shoots trailed aimlessly over the ground.
-----
You know how many a  noble power perishes in us because it is unused.
-----
I wandered like a  will-o'-the-wisp, caught at everything, was caught by everything, but  only for a moment, and my unskilled powers wore themselves out  for nothing.
-----
I felt that I was missing something everywhere, yet I  could not find my goal.
-----
Such was I when he found me.
-----
He had long applied all his patience and his art to his material,  the so-called cultivated world; but his material had been and had  remained stone and wood, even if under compulsion it outwardly  assumed the noble form of man; but that meant nothing to my  Adamas.
-----
He wanted men, and he had found his art too poor to  create them.
-----
Once upon a time they had existed, those whom he  sought, those whom his art was too poor to create—this he knew for      a certainty.
-----
Where they had existed he also knew.
-----
He resolved to go  there and search under the rubble for their genius and thus to  occupy his lonely days.
-----
He came to Greece.
-----
Such he was when I  found him.
-----
I still see him come walking toward me, looking at me and  smiling; I still hear his greeting and his questions.
-----
As a man stands before a plant whose peace soothes his struggling  spirit, and simple content returns to his soul—so he stood before  me.
-----
And I—was I not the echo of his quiet inspiration?
-----
did not the  melodies of his being repeat themselves in me?
-----
What I saw, I became; and what I saw was divine.
-----
How ineffectual is the best-intentioned diligence of men compared with the power of pure inspiration!
-----
It does not stop at the surface, does not take hold of us here or  there, needs no time and no means, has no use for command and  coercion and persuasion; from all sides, at every level of depth and  height, it seizes us instantly, and before we know it is there, before  we can ask what is befalling us, it transforms us through and  through, in all its beauty and bliss.
-----
Well for him whom a noble spirit has thus encountered in early  youth!
-----
Oh, those are golden, unforgettable days, filled with the joys of  love and sweet activity!
-----
Soon Adamas led me, now into Plutarch's world of heroes, now  into the magical land of the Greek gods; now he quieted my  youthful impatience with arithmetic and geometry, now he climbed  among the mountains with me—by day for field flowers and woodland flowers and the wild moss that grows on cliffs, by night that we might gaze at the sacred stars above us, and understand them as men  may.
-----
There is a precious sense of well-being in us when our inner life  thus draws strength from what is its material, differentiates itself,  and establishes truer inner relationships, and our mind gradually  comes of age to bear arms.
-----
But with threefold force did I feel him and myself when, like  shades from a time long past, in pride and joy, in rage and grief, we  climbed Mount Athos and from there sailed across to the Helles-     pont, then down to the shores of Rhodes and the mountain gorges  of Taenarum, through all the quiet islands; when longing drove us  from the coasts inland to the somber heart of ancient Peloponnesus,  to the lonely banks of the Eurotas (ah!
-----
the valleys, lifeless now, of  Elis and Nemea and Olympia!
-----
); when, leaning against a pillar of the  temple of the forgotten Jupiter, with oleander and periwinkle all  around us, we gazed into the wild riverbed, and the life of spring  and the eveivyoung sun bade us think that once man was there and  now is gone, that man's glorious nature, if it remains there at all,  remains but like a shattered fragment of a temple, or only in  memory, like the image of one dead—and there I sat, playing sadly  beside him, scraping die moss from a demigod's pedestal, digging a  marble hero's shoulder out of the rubble, cutting the brambles and  headier from the half-buried architraves, while my Adamas sketched  die landscape that embraced die ruin, kindly and comforting: the  wheat-covered hillock, the olive trees, die flock of goats hanging  from the mountain's cliffs, the forest of elms dropping down from  the peaks to the valley; and the lizard played at our feet and the flies  buzzed about us in the silence of noon—Dear Bellarmin, I want to  tell you of it all, point by point like Nestor; I move through the past  like a gleaner over the stubblefield when the landowner has harvested; he gathers up every straw.
-----
And when I stood beside him on the heights of Delos, what a day it was that dawned for me as I  climbed the ancient marble steps with him up the granite wall of  Cynthus.
-----
Here once the Sun God lived, amid the divine festivals at  which all Greece shone round him like a sky of golden clouds.
-----
Here  the youth of Hellas plunged into full tides of joy and exaltation, as  Achilles plunged into Styx, and came forth invincible as the demigod.
-----
In the groves, in die temples, their souls awoke and echoed musically in one another, and every youth faithfully guarded the  treasure of that enchanting harmony.
-----
But why do I speak of this?
-----
As if we still have even an inkling of  those days!
-----
Oh, not even a beautiful dream can flourish under the  curse that weighs upon us!
-----
Over the flowers of our spirit the present  blows like a howling north-wind, blasting them even in the bud.
-----
And yet it was a golden day that wrapped me there on Cynthus!
-----
It  was still gray dawn when we stood ön die summit.
-----
Now he rose, the ancient Sun God, in his eternal youth; at peace and effortlessly as    1  ever, the immortal Titan soared up with the thousand joys that are  his, and smiled down on his devastated country, on his temples, his  pillars, which fate had thrown down before him like withered rose  petals that a child heedlessly tore from the branch as it passed and  scattered over the ground.
-----
"Be you like him!"
-----
Adamas cried, and grasped my hand and held  it up toward the god; and it seemed to me that the winds of morning  bore us along with them in the train of the divine being who now, in  all his kindness and greatness, rose to the summit of the heavens,  and in splendor filled the world and us with his spirit and his power.
-----
My inmost heart still mourns and rejoices over every word that  Adamas spoke to me then, and I cannot understand how I can feel  destitute, when I often feel as he must then have felt.
-----
What is loss,  when a man finds himself in his own world?
-----
In us is all.
-----
Why should  a man be miserable if a hair falls from his head?
-----
Why does he  struggle so fiercely for servitude, when he could be a god?
-----
"You will  be lonely, dear child!"
-----
This, too, Adamas said to me dien.
-----
"You will  be like die crane whose brothers leave him behind in the harsh time  of the year, while they go to seek spring in a far country!"
-----
And there it is, dear friend!
-----
It is this that makes us poor among all  wealth, that we cannot be alone, that, so long as we live, love does  not perish in us.
-----
Give me my Adamas again, and come with all who  are akin to me, that the old, beautiful world may be renewed among  us, that we may join together and be one in the arms of our divinity,  Nature—and lo!
-----
I shall know nothing of lack.
-----
But let no one tell me that Eate parts us!
-----
It is we, we ourselves!
-----
we  delight in flinging ourselves into die night of the unknown, into the  cold strangeness of any other world, and, if we could, we would  leave the realm of the sun and rush headlong beyond the comet's  track.
-----
Ah!
-----
for a man's wild heart no home is possible; and as the  sun's ray shrivels the very plants of earth that it has brought to  bloom, so man kills the sweet flowers that flourish in his heart, the  joys of kinship and love.
-----
I seem to be chiding my Adamas for forsaking me, but I am not.
-----
Oh, he meant to come back!
-----
A people of rare capacity is said to be hidden somewhere in the  depths of Asia; there his hope drove him.
-----
I went with him as far as Nio.
-----
Those were bitter days.
-----
I have  learned to bear pain, but I have no strength for such a parting.
-----
With every moment that brought the last hour nearer, it became  more apparent how deeply this man was woven into the very texture  of my being.
-----
As one dying clings to his fleeing breath, so did my soul  cling to him.
-----
A few more days we passed at Homer's grave, and Nio became the  most sacred of islands to me.
-----
finally we tore ourselves away.
-----
My heart had struggled until it was  exhausted.
-----
I was calmer at the last moment.
-----
I knelt before him,  embraced him for the last time with these arms.
-----
"Give me a blessing,  my father," I cried softly up to him, and he smiled; there was  greatness in his smile, his brow widened in the light of the morning  stars, his eye pierced the depths of the heavens—"Guard him for  me," he cried, "you spirits of a better age!
-----
and draw him up to your  immortality; and all you kindly powers of Earth and Heaven, be  with him!"
-----
"There is a god in us," he added more quietly, "who guides  destiny as if it were a river of water, and all things are his element.
-----
Above all else, may he be with you!"
-----
So we parted.
-----
Farewell my Bellarmin!
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  How could I escape from myself, if I had not the sweet days of my  youth?
-----
Like a shade that finds no rest by Acheron, I return to the  forsaken scenes of my life.
-----
All things age and are rejuvenated.
-----
Why  are we excepted from this beautiful circling of Nature?
-----
Or does it  rule us, too?
-----
I should believe so, were it not for one trait that is in us—the  gigantic striving to be all things, which, like Aetna's Titan, rages up  from the depths of our being.
-----
And yet, who would not rather feel it within him, like seething oil,  than acknowledge that he was born for the whip and the yoke?
-----
A  raging battlehorse, or a workhorse with hanging ears—which is the  nobler?
-----
Dear friend!
-----
there was a time when my heart, too, basked under  the sun of great hopes, when the joy of immortality pulsed in my  every vein, when I roved among beautiful projects as through the    1  half light of a vast forest, when, happy as the fish in the sea in my  boundless future, I pressed on, farther, ever farther*  How boldly, blessed Nature!
-----
did the youth leap from your cradle!
-----
how he rejoiced in his untried weapons!
-----
His bow was drawn, his  arrows rattled in the quiver, and the immortals, the high spirits of  Antiquity, led him on, and his Adamas was among them.
-----
Wherever I went, wherever I stopped, their glorious presences  were with me; in my thought the high deeds of all the ages were  mingled together, and as those gigantic forms, the clouds of heaven,  united in one exultant storm, so the hundredfold victories of the Olympiads were united in me, so did they become one never-ending  victory.
-----
Who can abide it, whom does it not lay low, as a hurricane lays  low young woods, when the terrifying splendor of Antiquity seizes  him as it seized me, when, as for me, die surroundings are lacking in  which he might gain a strengthening self-reliance?
-----
Oh, as for me, the greatness of the ancients bowed my head like a  storm, swept the bloom from my face, and often I lay where no eye  saw me, weeping a thousand tears, as a fallen fir tree lies by a stream  and hides its faded crown in the water.
-----
How gladly would I have paid  with blood for one moment from the life of a great man!
-----
But what use was that?
-----
No one wanted me!
-----
Oh, it is pitiful to see oneself so reduced to nothing; and let him  who does not understand this ask no more but give thanks to  Nature who made him, like the butterflies, for joy; let him go and  never in his lifetime speak again of pain and unhappiness.
-----
I loved my heroes as a moth loves the light; I sought their perilous  presence, and fled, and sought it again.
-----
As a bleeding stag plunges into the stream, so I often plunged into  the whirlpool of pleasures, to cool my burning breast and bathe  away the raging, glorious dreams of fame and greatness, but what  use was that?
-----
And when, as often toward midnight, my empassioned heart  drove me down into the garden under the dewy trees, and the  lullaby of the fountain and the sweet air and the moonlight soothed  my thoughts, and the silver clouds moved in such freedom and peace  above me, and from far away the fading voice of the sea qune faintly,      how graciously then did all the great phantoms that it loved play  with my heart!
-----
"Farewell, you heavenly spirits!"
-----
I often said in thought, when  above me the melody of the dawn's light began softly sounding.
-----
"You glorious dead, farewell!
-----
Would that I could follow you, would  that I could cast off all that my century has given me, and make my  way into the freer realm of the shades!
-----
But I languish on the chain and snatch with bitter joy the miserly  bowl that is offered to my thirst.
-----
* * *  Hyperion to Bellarmin  My island had become too cramped for me, now that Adamas was  gone.
-----
For years, in fact, Una had bored me.
-----
I wanted to go out into  the world.
-----
"Go to Smyrna first," said my father; "master the arts of navigation and war there, learn the speech of cultivated peoples and their political constitutions, their views, their manners and customs,  investigate everything, and choose the best!—Go on from there, if  you will."
-----
"Learn a little patience, too," my mother added, and I accepted  the advice gratefully.
-----
To take die first step beyond the circle of youth is pure enchantment; it is as if I were thinking of my birthday when I think of my departure from Una.
-----
There was a new sun above me, and I enjoyed  land and sea and air as if for the first time.
-----
The ardor and activity with which I now pursued my education in  Smyrna, and my speedy progress, did not a little to calm my heart,  and I remember, too, many a blissful holiday evening from that  time.
-----
How often I walked under the evergreen trees on the bank of  the Meles, by the birthplace of my Homer, and picked an offering of  flowers and cast them into the sacred stream!
-----
Then in my peaceful  dreams I approached the nearby grotto where, they say, the old man  sang his load.
-----
I found him.
-----
Every sound in me was stilled by his    1  presence.
-----
I opened his divine poem, and it was as if I had never  known it, so differently did it now come to life in me.
-----
I like to remember, too, my wanderings through the countryside  around Smyrna.
-----
It is a radiant land, and a thousand times I have  wished I had wings, that once a year I might fly to Asia Minor.
-----
From the plain of Sardis I climbed up die rock cliffs of Tmolus.
-----
I had spent the night in a hospitable hut at the foot of the  mountain, among myrdes and the scent of the labdanum-bearing  cistus, where in the golden stream of Factolus the swans played  beside me, where an ancient temple of Cybele looked out from the  elms into the clear moonlight like a shy ghost, five lovely pillars  mourned over the rubble, and a kingly portal lay fallen at their feet.
-----
Now my path passed upward through a thousand blossoming  shrubs.
-----
Whispering trees leaned down from the rugged slope, dropping their delicate floss on my head.
-----
I had set out with the morning.
-----
By noon I reached the summit of the mountain.
-----
I stood, looking  happily about me, relishing the purer airs of the sky.
-----
They were  blessed hours.
-----
Like a sea, the countryside from which I had climbed up lay  spread before me, youthful, filled with living joy; spring's heavenly,  unending play of colors greeted my heart; and, even as the Sun in the  heavens found itself again in the thousand changes of light that die  Earth sent back to him, so my spirit recognized itself in the fullness  of life that was all about it, that beset it from every side.
-----
To the left the stream, an exulting giant, plunged down into the  woods from the marble cliff that hung over me, where the eagle  played with his fledglings, where the snow-crowned peaks glittered  up into the blue ether; to the right storm clouds came rolling over  the forests of Sipylus; I did not feel the rushing wind that bore them  on, I felt only a feint breeze in my hair; but I heard their thunder as  we hear the voice of the future, and I saw their flames, like the  distant light of dimly apprehended divinity.
-----
I turned southward and  walked on.
-----
Now there lay before me the whole paradisal countryside through which the Caystrus flows in so many an enchanting meander, as if it could not linger long enough amid the profusion  and loveliness that surrounds it.
-----
Like the zephyrs, my spirit wandered blissfully from beauty to beauty, from unknown, peaceful villages lying deep at the foot of the mountain, on to where die  chain of Messogis was dimly visible.
-----
I came back to Smyrna like ajjomkSRinan from afea&t.
-----
My heart  was too full of pleasant things not to impart some of its abundance  to mortal existence; Nature had yielded me too happy a treasure of  her loveliness for me not to make good the deficiencies of human life  with it.
-----
My paltry Smyrna clad herself in the colors of my enthusiasm and stood before me like a bride.
-----
Her flocking citizens attracted me.
-----
The absurdity of their ways amused me like a children's prank;  and since by nature I was above their established forms and customs,  I played with them all, putting them on and taking them off like  carnival costumes.
-----
But what I now found giving some flavor to the insipid fare of  daily life was the well-proportioned faces and figures that compassionate Nature still sends, here and there, like stars into our darkness.
-----
What heartfelt pleasure I took in them!
-----
With what faith did I read  those smiling hieroglyphics!
-----
But I had almost the same experience  with them that I had had long ago with birches in spring.
-----
I had  heard of the sap of these trees and was amazed at the thought of  what a precious drink their graceful stems must yield.
-----
But there was  neither strength nor life enough in it.
-----
And, oh!
-----
how irredeemably wanting was everything else that I  heard and saw!
-----
As I went now here, now there, among these people, it seemed to  me that human nature had resolved itself into the multifarious  species of die animal kingdom.
-----
As everywhere, so here, too, the men  were especially demoralized and corrupted.
-----
Some animals howl when they hear music.
-----
But my more man-  nerly humans laughed when the conversation turned to beauty of  spirit and virtue of heart.
-----
Wolves run away when you strike a light.
-----
When these men saw a spark of reason, they turned their backsjike  thieves.
-----
~ IF ever I happened to say a warm word for ancient Greece, they  yawned and said that after all a man had to live in this day and age;  and—someone else added sententiously—good taste had not perished from the earth.
-----
And so I saw: one would crack jokes like a sailor, another puffed  out his cheeks and delivered old sayings.
-----
Yet another, to demonstrate what an advanced thinker he was,  .would snap his fingers at Heaven and cry that he had never worried    1  ahautihe_hinkia_th.e bush, give him Jbirds in the hand!
-----
Yet when  death was mentioned he would at once clasp his hands, and as the  conversation went on, would manage to put in that it was a very  dangerous thing that our priests no longer had any influence.
-----
The only people from whom I sometimes profited were the storytellers, the living gazettes of foreign cities and countries, the speaking peep-boxes in which one can see potentates on chargers and church steeples and markets.
-----
At last I grew weary of wasting myself, of looking for grapes in the  desert and flowers on a glacier.
-----
I now lived more determinedly alone, and the sweet spirit of my  youth had almost vanished from my heart.
-----
The incurable corruption  of my century became so apparent to me from so many things that 1  tell you and do not tell you, and my beautiful faith that I would find  my world in one soul, that I would embrace my whole kind in one  sympathetic being—that, too, was denied me.
-----
Dear friend!
-----
What would life be without hope?
-----
A spark that leaps  from coal and goes out, a blast of wind in the dreary time of the  year, heard for a moment and then still forever—would it be so with  us?
-----
Even the swallow seeks a more hospitable country in winter, the  wild beasts run here and there in the heat of the day, their eyes search  for the stream.
-----
Who tells the babe that its mother will not deny it the  breast?
-----
And yet it seeks for it!
-----
Nothing would live if it did not hope.
-----
My heart now shut away its  treasures, but only to keep them safe for a better time, for the  unique, the sacred revelation of fidelity that surely, at some epoch of  my existence, would come to my thirsting soul.
-----
How blissfully I often clung to it when, in hours of veiled anticipation, it played about me softly as moonlight, soothing my brow.
-----
Even then I knew you; even then, maiden, you looked down at me  from the clouds like a Genius—you who in time to come rose before  me out of the turbid sea of the world in all the peace of beauty!
-----
Then  this heart struggled and burned no more.
-----
As a lily sways in newly stilled air, so my being moved in its  element, in my ravishing dreams of her.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Smyrna had lost all attraction for me now.
-----
Altogether, my heart had  grown gradually wearier.
-----
At moments, to be sure, die wish could  still take me to travel through the world, or to turn soldier and fight  in some war, or to find my Adamas and burn my discontent to ashes  in his fire; but that was as far as it ever went, and my meaningless,  parched life refused to be renewed.
-----
Soon summer was over; I already anticipated the sullen days of  rain, and the whistling winds, and the roar of storm-swollen  streams, and Nature, which had surged up into every plant and tree  like a foaming fountain, now stood before my darkened apprehen-  sion fading and closed and turned in upon itself, just as I was.
-----
Yet I wanted to take with me what I could of all this fleeting life;  everything outward to which I had become attached, I wanted to  preserve within me, for I knew well that the returning year would  not find me among these trees and mountains, so now I walked and  rode more than ever before through the countryside.
-----
But what most impelled me to go out was my secret longing to see  a man whom for some little time I had come upon every day when I  passed under the trees outside the city gate.
-----
Like a young Titan, this noble stranger strode resplendent among  that race of dwarfs, who fed upon his beauty in joyous dread,  measured his tall stature and his strength, and with covert glances  regaled themselves on the Roman majesty of his shining face, as  upon forbidden fruit.
-----
And it was a glorious moment each time that  this man's eye, for whose glance the ether seemed too narrow, put off  all pride and searched until, with an effort, it found its way to mine  and, blushing, we gazed at each other and passed on.
-----
One day I had ridden deep into the forest on Mount Mimas and  did not start back until late in the evening.
-----
I had dismounted and was  leading my horse down a steep, wild path, over roots and stones.
-----
As  I was thus making my way through the underbrush into the gulf that  now opened before me, a pair of Karaborniote robbers suddenly fell  on me, and for a moment it was hard to fight off the two drawn  sabers; but they were already tired from other work, so I managed.
-----
I  quiedy mounted my horse again and rode on.
-----
At the foot of the mountain, between woods and soaring cliffs, a    1  little meadow opened before me.
-----
It grew light.
-----
The moon had just  risen over the dark trees.
-----
Some distance away I saw horses lying  stretched out and men beside them on the grass.
-----
"Who are you?"
-----
I cried.
-----
"That is Hyperion!"
-----
cried a voice that rang like a hero's, in happy  surprise.
-----
"You know me," the voice continued; "I see you every day under the trees outside the city gate."
-----
My horse flew to him like an arrow.
-----
The moon shone bright on  his face.
-----
I recognized him; I sprang to the ground.
-----
"Good evening!"
-----
he cried, charming in his youthful vigor, and  looked at me with his wild eyes subdued to tenderness, while his  sinewy hand grasped mine so that the touch of it penetrated to my  inmost being.
-----
Oh!
-----
now my meaningless life was at an end!
-----
Alabanda (such was the stranger's name) now told me that he and  his servant had been set upon by robbers, that the two I had come  upon had been sent about their business by him, that he had missed  the path out of the woods, and so had been obliged to stay where he  was until I arrived.
-----
"It has cost me a friend," he added, and pointed  to his dead horse.
-----
I turned mine over to his servant, and he and I set out together on  foot.
-----
"It served us right," I began, as, arm in arm, we made our way out  of the wood; "why did we hesitate so long and pass each other by,  until misfortune brought us together?"
-----
"But it was you, I must tell you," answered Alabanda, "who were  most to blame; you were the colder.
-----
I rode after you today."
-----
"Noble youth!"
-----
I cried, "wait and see!
-----
You shall never surpass me in love!"
-----
We became ever more intimate and happier together.
-----
Near to the city we passed a well-built caravansary, set peacefully  among murmuring brooks and fruit trees and sweet-scented meadows.
-----
We decided to spend the night there.
-----
For a long time we sat on  together by the open window.
-----
The high silence of spirit enveloped  us.
-----
Earth and ocean were blissfully silent, like the stars that hung  above us.
-----
It was much if even a breeze flitted into the room from the  sea and played delicately with the candle, or if the stronger tones of      more distant music penetrated to us, while the thunderclouds lulled  themselves to sleep in the bed of the ether, now and again to sound  distantly, as a sleeping giant breathes more heavily in his dreaded  dreams.
-----
Our souls were impelled toward each other all the more strongly  because they had come together against our will.
-----
We met like two  brooks that, pouring from a mountain, throw off their burden of  earth and stone and rotten wood and the whole sluggish chaos that  holds them back, determined to clear the way to each other, to burst  through until, clasping and clasped with equal force, they set out,  mingled in one majestic stream, on their long journey to the sea.
-----
He, driven by fate and human barbarity from his own home to  wander among strangers, embittered and unguided from early  youth, and yet with his inmost heart full of love, full of longing to  break out of the coarse husk and win through into a congenial  element; I, already so profoundly cut off from everything, so utterly  and determinedly a stranger and alone among men, with the most  precious melody of my heart so absurdly accompanied by all the  world's tinkling bells; I, the scorn and aversion of all the lame and  the blind, and yet in my own judgment only too lame and blind, so  intolerably burdensome to myself by everything in me that was even  distantly akin to worldly wisdom and pseudo-reason, to the barbarians and the would-be wits—and so full of hope, so single-mindecfly awaiting but one thing, a more beautiful l i f e -  Was it not inevitable that these two youths should embrace each  other in such joyous and impetuous haste?
-----
O my friend and brother-in-arms, my Alabanda!
-----
where are you?
-----
I  almost believe that you have made your way to the unknown land, to  rest, have become again what once we were as children.
-----
Sometimes, when a storm passes over me, dispensing its divine  powers among woods and sown fields alike, or when the waves of  the sea play together, or a choral train of eagles soars about the  mountain peaks among which I am wandering, my heart can stir as  if my Alabanda were not far away.
-----
But more visibly, more presently^  more unmistakably does he live in me—the whole man—as once he  stood, stern and aglow and terrible, denouncing the sins of this  century.
-----
How my spirit awoke in its depths!
-----
how the thundering  words of implacable justice rolled on my tongue!
-----
Like messengers of    2  Nemesis, our thoughts journeyed over the whole earth, purifying it  until no trace of a curse remained.
-----
We summoned the past, too, before our bar of justice, and proud  Rome did not cow us with its splendor nor Athens corrupt us with  its youthful bloom.
-----
As storms, exulting in their unwearied play, travel on through  forests, over mountains, so our souls drove ever forward in colossal  projects—not that we effeminately created our world as by a magic  spell and, childishly inexperienced, expected no resistance; Ala-  banda was too intelligent and too brave for that.
-----
But even spontaneous enthusiasm is often militant and shrewd.
-----
One day is especially present to me.
-----
We had gone to the country together and were sitting with our  arms trustfully around each other in the dark shade of an ever green  laurel, looking at our Plato—the passage where he speaks with such  wondrous sublimity of aging and rejuvenation, and from time to  time we rested, looking out over the mute, leafless landscape, where  the sky, playing with clouds and sunlight, was more than ever  beautiful among the autumnally sleeping trees.
-----
We then spoke much of Greece as it is today, both of us with  bleeding hearts, for the desecrated soil was Alabanda's native country too.
-----
Alabanda was moved to a degree most unusual in him.
-----
"When I see a child," he cried, "and think how shameful and  stultifying is the yoke that it will bear, and that it will starve as we  do, look for men as we do, search after truth and beauty as we do,  will waste away in bairen pining because it is alone as we are, that  it— O men of this land!
-----
take your sons from the cradle and cast  them into the river, that at least they will be spared your ignominy!"
-----
"Surely, Alabanda," said I, "surely, it will not always be so."
-----
"What can change it?"
-----
he answered.
-----
"Our heroes have lost their  fame, our wise men their pupils.
-----
Great deeds, when there is no  people to understand them, are no more than a powerful blow on an  unresponsive brow, and high words, when they do not echo in high  hearts, are like a dying leaf rustling down onto dung.
-----
What are you  going to do?"
-----
"I will take a shovel and throw the dung into a pit.
-----
A people      among whom spirit and greatness no longer engenders any spirit  and any greatness has nothing in common with other peoples who  are still men, has no more rights, and it is an empty farce, sheer  superstition, to go on honoring such will-less corpses as if a Roman  heart beat in them» Away with them!
-----
The withered, decaying tree  jshall not stand where it stands, it steals light and air from the young  life that is ripening for a new world!"
-----
Alabanda flew to me and embraced me, and his kisses penetrated  to my soul» "Companion in the fight!"
-----
he cried, "dear brother!
-----
oh, now I have a hundred arms!
-----
"I have heard my melody at last," he continued, in a voice that  stirred my heart like a battle cry; "it is enough!
-----
You have spoken a  glorious word, Hyperion» What!
-----
shall the god be dependent upon  die worm?
-----
The god in us, for whose road infinity lies open—shall he  stand and wait until the worm crawls out of his way?
-----
No!
-----
no!
-----
We do  not ask if you are willing, you slaves and barbarians!
-----
You are never  willing!
-----
Nor will we try to make you better, for that is useless!
-----
We  will but make certain that you get out of the way of humanity's  victorious career!
-----
Oh!
-----
let someone light a torch for me, that I may  burn the weeds from the field, let someone lay me the mine with  which I can blow the dull clods from the face of the earth!"
-----
5  "When possible, we should but gendy push them aside,"91 interrupted»  Alabanda was silent for a while»  "I find my joy in the future," he began again at last, and ardently  seized both my hands» "Thank God, I shall come to no common  end!
-----
To be happy means to be sleepy, in the language of slaves»  Happiness!
-----
it is as if I had pap and lukewarm water in my mouth  when they talk to me of happiness» So vapid and so irredeemable is  all for which you slaves give up your laurel crowns, your immortality!
-----
"Oh, holy light, which, moving tirelessly above us, fills all its  immense realm with its power and imparts its soul even unto me in  the rays that I drink—may your bliss be mine!
-----
"The children of the sun live by their deeds; they live by victory;  their own spirit rouses them, and their strength is their joy."
-----
The spirit of this man often laid hold of me with such force that I    2  might well have felt ashamed of being snatched up and carried away  like a feather.
-----
"O Heaven and Earth!"
-----
I cried, "this is joy!—This is another age, this is no voice from my infantile century, this is not the soil on  which the heart of man pants under the oppressor's whip,—Yes!
-----
yes!
-----
by your glorious soul, O man!
-----
you will save my fatherland!"
-----
"So I will,* he cried, "or perish."
-----
From that day on we became ever more sacred, ever dearer to each  other.
-----
A gravity of purpose that was indescribably profound had  arisen between us.
-----
Each of us lived only in the eternal fundamental  Jones of his being, and we moved austerely from one great harmony  to another.
-----
Our life together was filled with glorious sternness and  courage.
-----
"Whatever has made you so tongue-tied?"
-----
Älabanda once smilingly asked me.
-----
"In the tropical regions, nearer the sun," said I, "the birds do not sing either."
-----
But everything is now up, now down in this world, and man, for  all his gigantic powers, holds on to nothing.
-----
I once saw a child put  out its hand to catch the moonlight; but the light went calmly on its  way.
-----
So do we stand trying to hold back ever-changing Fate.
-----
Oh, that it were possible but to watch it as peacefully and meditatively as we do the circling stars!
-----
The happier one is, the less it takes to destroy one, and such  blissful days as Alabanda and I were living are like a steep cliff  where your traveling companion has but to touch you to fling you  involuntarily down over the jagged edge into the lightless depths.
-----
We had made a glorious voyage to Chios, had found a thousand  joys in each other.
-----
Like breezes over the plain of the sea, the kindly  enchantment of Nature had played about us.
-----
We looked at each  other in happy surprise, without speaking, but our eyes said: I have  never seen you like this.
-----
So gloriously transfigured were we by the  powers of Earth and Heaven.
-----
We had argued, too, gaily and ardently, over many things during  the voyage; as so often before, I had taken the most heartfelt delight  in watching that spirit on its bold, erratic course, following its path  in such unconstrained gladness still for the most part so unfalteringly.
-----
No sooner had we landed than we hastened to be alone.
-----
"You cannot persuade anyone," I cried with fondest love; "you  convince men, you win them over, before you begin.
-----
When you  speak, none can doubt; and he who does not doubt is not persuaded."
-----
"Proud flatterer!"
-----
he cried in answer.
-----
"You lie!
-----
But you have given me a timely reminder.
-----
Only too often have you made me forsake  reason!
-----
Nor for the world and all its crowns would I be freed of you,  but it often troubles me that you are so indispensable to me, that I  am so bound to you.
-----
And since," he continued, "you possess me so  entirely, it is time that you knew me entirely!
-----
Amid all these splendors and all our joys, we have not thought of looking back at the past."
-----
And he told me the story of hislife; I felt as if I were watching a  young Hercules battling with Megaera.
-----
"Now will you forgive me," he ended the tale of his adversities,  "will you take it more calmly if I am often harsh and offensive and  intolerable?"
-----
"Be silent, silent!"
-----
I cried, moved to the depths; "it is wonder  enough that you are still here, that you kept yourself alive for me!"
-----
"Yes, for you!"
-----
he cried, "and it rejoices my heart that I am still a palatable dish for you.
-----
And if I sometimes taste like a crab apple to  you, squeeze me in the press until I am fit to drink."
-----
"Let me be!
-----
let me be!"
-----
I cried; I strove in vain, the man turned me  into a child, and I could not hide it from him; he saw my tears, and  woe to him if he had not the right to see them!
-----
"We are rioting in pleasures," Alabanda began again; "we are  wasting time in drunkenness."
-----
"We are celebrating our betrothal," I cried gaily, "it is only right that it should sound as if we were in Arcadia.—But to return to  what we were talking of earlier!
-----
"You accord the state far too much power.
-----
It must not demand  what it cannot extort.
-----
But what love gives, and spirit, cannot be  extorted.
-----
Let the state leave that alone, or we will take its laws and  whip them into the pillory!
-----
By Heaven!
-----
he knows not what his sin is  who would make the state a school of morals.
-----
The state has always  been made a hell by man's wanting to make it his heaven.
-----
"The state is the coarse husk around the seed of life, and nothing  more.
-----
It is the wall around the garden of human fruits and flowers.
-----
2  "But is the wall around the garden of any help when the soil lies  parched?
-----
Only the rain from heaven helps then.
-----
"O rain from heaven!
-----
O inspiration!
-----
you will bring us the springtime of peoples again.
-----
The state cannot command your presence.
-----
But let it not obstruct you, and you will come, come with your all-  conquering ecstasies, will wrap us in golden clouds and carry us up  above this mortal world; and we shall marvel and wonder if this is  still we, we who in our poverty asked the stars if a spring bloomed  for us among them.—Do you ask me when this will be?
-----
It will be  when the darling of Time, the youngest, loveliest daughter of Tune,  the new Church, will arise out of these polluted, antiquated forms,  when the awakened feeling of the divine will bring man his divinity,  man's heart its beautiful youth again, when—I cannot prophesy it,  for my eyes are too dim to surmise it, but it will come, that I know  for certain.
-----
Death is a messenger of life, and that we now lie asleep in  our infirmaries testifies that we shall soon awaken to new health.
-----
Then, and not till then, shall we exist, then, then will our spirit's  element have been found!"
-----
Alabanda was silent and gazed at me for a moment in astonishment.
-----
I was carried away by boundless hopes; divine forces bore me on like a summer cloud—  "Come!"
-----
I cried and grasped his garment, "come!
-----
who can any  longer abide in the prison that darkens around us?"
-----
"Come where, my enthusiast?"
-----
Alabanda answered drily, and a  shadow of mockery seemed to pass over his face.
-----
I was as if fallen from the clouds.
-----
"Go!"
-----
I said, "you are a small man!"
-----
At that moment some strangers entered the room.
-----
They were  striking figures, haggard and pale for the most part, so far as I could  see by the moonlight, and calm, but there was something in their  countenances that pierced the soul like a sword, and it was as if one  were standing in the presence of omniscience; one would have  doubted that this was the outward form of creatures subject to  needs, if here and there slain emotion had not left its traces.
-----
One of them struck me especially.
-----
The stillness of his features was  the stillness of a battlefield.
-----
Wrath and love had raged in this man,  and understanding shone over the wreckage of feeling like the eye of  a hawk perched upon ruined palaces.
-----
Profound contempt was on his  lips.
-----
One felt that this man was bent upon no insignificant purpose.
-----
Another appeared to owe his calm rather to a natural hardness of  heart.
-----
He showed almost no trace of violence perpetrated either by  his own will or by Fate.
-----
A third seemed rather to have wrested his coldness from life by the  force of his conviction, and still to be often at odds with himself; for  there was a concealed contradiction in his being, and I thought that  he had to keep a tight rein on himself.
-----
Of them all, he spoke the  least.
-----
As they entered, Alabanda sprang up like bent steel.
-----
aWe have been seeking you," one cried.
-----
"You would find me," he said with a laugh, "if I were hidden at  the center of the earth.
-----
They are my friends," he added, turning to  me.
-----
They seemed to scrutinize me with a certain severity.
-----
"He, too, is one of those who would see the world a better place,"  Alabanda cried after a moment, and pointed to me.
-----
aAre you serious in this?"
-----
one of the three asked me.
-----
"It is no joking matter to better the world," said I.  aYou have said much in little!"
-----
cried one.
-----
aYou are our man!"
-----
added another.
-----
"Are you of the same mind as I?"
-----
I asked.
-----
"Ask what we are doing," came the answer.
-----
aAndifIasked?"
-----
aWe would tell you we are here to purge the earth, that we clear  the stones from die field and break up the hard clods with the  mattock and draw furrows with the plow, that we grasp the rank  growth by the roots, cut it through at die roots, and tear it up by the  roots, so that it shall wither in the burning sun."
-----
"Not that we may reap»" another interrupted; "the reward of our  labors will come too late for us; the harvest will not ripen in our  time.
-----
"We are at the evening of our days.
-----
We often went wrong, we  hoped much and did little.
-----
We ventured rather than deliberated.
-----
We  were eager to have done and trusted to luck.
-----
We spoke much of joy  and sorrow and loved and hated them both.
-----
We played with fate, and  fate with us.
-----
It tossed us high and low, from beggar's staff to crown.
-----
It swung us as one swings a glowing censer, and we glowed until the  coals turned to ashes.
-----
We have ceased to speak of good and evil  fortune.
-----
We have grown beyond the midpoint of life, where it is    2  green and warm.
-----
But it is not the worst in man that outlives youth.
-----
The cold sword is forged from hot metal.
-----
They say that grapes  grown on burned-out, dead volcanoes yield no bad cider."
-----
"We say this not for our sake," another now cried in more hurried  tones, "but for yours!
-----
We do not go begging for mens> hearts.
-----
For we  need neither their hearts nor their wills.
-----
For men are in no case  against us, since everything is for us, and the fools and the cunning,  the simple and the wise, and all the vices and virtues of incivility and  good breeding are at our service without hire and blindly help us on  toward our goal—we only hope that some might be found to know  the joy of it, and so, among our thousand blind helpers, we choose  out the best, that we may make them into seeing helpers—but if no  one wants to live where we have built, it is neither our fault nor our  loss.
-----
We did what was for us to do.
-----
If no one wants to reap where we  plowed, who can blame us for that?
-----
Who upbraids the tree when its  fruit falls into the mire?
-----
I have often said to myself 'You are  sacrificing to decay,' and yet I finished my day's work."
-----
"These are traitors!"
-----
the very walls dinned into my sensitive heart.
-----
I felt like one suffocating in smoke, breaking open doors and  windows to escape—so did I thirst for air and freedom.
-----
They soon saw, too, how uneasy I felt, and broke off.
-----
Day was  already dawning when I stepped out of the boat where we had been  together.
-----
I felt the morning breeze like balsam on a burning wound.
-----
I was already too irritated by Alabanda's mockery not to be  completely confused by his having these mysterious friends.
-----
"He is evil," I cried, "yes, evil!
-----
He feigns unbounded trust, and consorts with such as these—and hides it from you!"
-----
I felt like a girl who learns that her betrothed is secretly living  with a whore.
-----
Oh, it was not the grief that one can cherish, that one carries in  one's heart like a child, that sings in sleep with the voice of the  nightingale!
-----
Like a raging snake that, gliding implacably up legs and loins to  coil round every limb, sinks its poisonous fangs now into its victim's  chest, now into his back—so it held me in its terrible embrace.
-----
I  summoned all the courage of my heart to my aid, and struggled for  noble thoughts, that I might remain calm; for a few moments I  succeeded, but now I had gained strength enough for fury, and now,  as if it were arson, I killed every spark of love in me.
-----
"He must," I thought, "yes—for these are his friends—he must be  conspiring with them against you!
-----
But what did he want with you?
-----
What could he have been trying to get from you and your enthusiasm?
-----
Oh, had he but gone his way!
-----
But these people have a strange desire to take up with their opposite!
-----
to have some peculiar animal  in their stables suits them to perfection!
-----
"—  And yet I had been unspeakably happy with him, had so often  sunk into his embraces only to awaken from them with my heart  invincible, had so often been hardened and refined in his fire like  steel!
-----
On one serene midnight, when I pointed out the Dioscuri to him,  Alabanda laid his hand on my heart and said: "These are but stars,  Hyperion, by which the name of the heroic brotfiers is written in the  sky; but they are in us, living and true, with their courage and their  jdivine love, and you!
-----
you are the son of a God and share your  immortality with your mortal Castor!
-----
"—  When once f wandered through the forests of Ida with him, and  we made our way down into the valley that we might ask the silent  grave mounds there to tell us of their dead, and I said to Älabanda  that one among them might perhaps belong to the spirit of Achilles  and his beloved, and Alabanda confided to me that he was often  childish enough to think that we would fall together in one battle-torn valley and rest together under one tree—who then would have  thought what was to come?
-----
I reflected with all the power of thought that remained to me, I  accused him, defended him, accused him again all the more bitterly;  I struggled against my emotions, determined to be cheerful, and  thereby only plunged myself in blackest darkness.
-----
Ah!
-----
my eye was already so sore from many blows, was only just  beginning to heal—how could it see more healthily now?
-----
Alabanda visited me the next day.
-----
My heart boiled when he  entered, but I controlled myself, however much his pride and imperturbability agitated and infuriated me.
-----
"The air is glorious," he said at last, "and it will be a very  beautiful evening; let us go up to the Acropolis together!"
-----
I accepted.
-----
For a long time we said not a word.
-----
"What do you  want?"
-----
I at last asked.
-----
"Can you ask me that?"
-----
the tameless youth answered, with a  melancholy that pierced my soul.
-----
I was stricken, bewildered.
-----
2  "What am I to think of you?"
-----
I began again at last.
-----
"What I am," he answered calmly.
-----
"You must cleanse yourself," I said in a changed voice, and  looked at him proudly, "cleanse yourself!
-----
absolve yourself!"
-----
That was too much for him.
-----
"How does it happen," he cried indignantly, "that this fellow can twist me as he pleases?—True enough, I was turned out of school  too early.
-----
I had dragged all chains and I had broken them, only one  remained, only one was still to be snapped, I had not yet been  chided by a weathercock of a fellow—stop your muttering, I have  kept silent long enough!"
-----
"O Alabanda, Alabanda," I cried.
-----
"Be still," he answered; "and use not my name as a dagger against me."
-----
Now anger raged uncontrolled in me, too.
-----
We did not rest until  any turning back was well-nigh impossible.
-----
We violently destroyed  the garden of our love.
-----
Often we stopped and stood silent, and oh so  gladly, so joyously would we have fallen on each other's necks; but  accursed pride stifled every tone of love that rose from our hearts.
-----
"Farewell!"
-----
I cried at last, and rushed away.
-----
But against my will I  looked back, and against his will Alabanda had followed me.
-----
"A strange beggar, is he not, Alabanda?"
-----
I cried; "he throws his  last penny into the bog!"
-----
"If he does, then let him go hungry!"
-----
he cried, and left me.
-----
I staggered away, stupefied.
-----
Then I was standing by the sea, gazing  at the waves—ah!
-----
it was beneath them that my heart longed to be,  there beneath them, and my arms flew toward the unfettered tide;  but soon, as if from heaven, a gentler spirit came over me and  restrained my unruly, sorrowing heart with its peaceable rod; more  tranquilly now, I reflected on the course of my life, my belief in the  world, my cheerless experiences, I considered men, as I had felt  them and known them from my early youth, men of the most  various upbringing, and everywhere I found but false notes, muffled  or strident; only in the simple confines of the child did I find pure  melodies—"It is better," I said to myself, "to become as the bee and build one's house in innocence, than to rule with the masters of the  world and howl with them as with wolves, than to dominate peoples  and befoul one's hands with that unclean material."
-----
I wanted to go  back to Una and live for my gardens and fields.
-----
Smile if you will!
-----
I was utterly serious.
-----
If the life of the world  consists in an alternation between opening and closing, between  going forth and returning, why is it not even so with the heart of  man?
-----
To be sure, I found this new lesson hard to accept; to be sure, I  dreaded turning from the error of my youth—who gladly tears pff  his wings?—but it had to be so!
-----
I went through with it.
-----
I took ship.
-----
A fresh wind from the  mountains drove me out of the harbor of Smyrna.
-----
In a miraculous  peace, exactly like a child that knows nothing of the instant to come,  I lay in my bark and gazed at the trees and mosques of the city, my  eyes traced my green walks along the shore, the path by which I  climbed the Acropolis, I saw them and let them go, recede farther  and farther; but now, as I came out into the open sea, and everything  slowly sank down behind me, like a coffin into a grave, suddenly it  was as if my heart had broken—"O Heaven!"
-----
I cried, and all the life  in me awoke and strove to hold back the fleeing present, but it was  gone, gone!
-----
Like a mist it lay before me, the divine land where, like a deer free  of the meadow, I had wandered far and wide through valleys and  mountains, and brought the echo of my heart to springs and  streams, to the distances and depths of the earth.
-----
There inland I had climbed Tmolus in solitary innocence; down  there where Ephesus once stood in its happy youth and Teos and  Miletus, up there in the sacred, mourning Troad, I had wandered  with Alabanda, with Alabanda!
-----
and there like a god I had ruled  him, and like a tender, confiding child I had obeyed his eye in joy of  soul, with the most intense delight in his being, always happy,  whether I held his horse for him or, carried above myself, I met his  soul in glorious resolves, in daring thoughts, in the fire erf eloquence!
-----
And now it was all over, now I was nothing, now I had been so  irremediably deprived of everything, had become the poorest of  men, and did not myself know how.
-----
"O eternal labyrinth!"
-----
I thought, "when will man escape from  your chains?"
-----
We speak of our hearts, of our plans, as if they were ours; yet there  is a power outside of us that tosses us here and there as it pleases  until it lays us in the grave, and of which we know not whence it  comes nor where it is bound.
-----
3  We want to grow upward, and spread wide our branches and  twigs, yet soil and weather bring us to whatever is to be, and when  the lightning strikes your crown and splits you to die roots, poor  tree!
-----
what part do you have in it?
-----
So I thought.
-----
Are you displeased, my Bellarmin?
-----
There is yet more  that you must hear.
-----
The sad thing, dear friend, is that our mind so eagerly assumes  the posture of our erring heart, so fondly clings to passing grief, that  thought, which should heal sorrows, itself sickens, that the gardener, charged with planting rosebushes, so often tears his hand on them—oh!
-----
this has made a fool of many a man before others whom,  but for this, he would have ruled like an Orpheus, this has so often  made the noblest nature a laughingstock to such fellows as can be  found in every street, this is the hidden reef for the favored of  Heaven—that their love is strong and tender like their spirit, that  their hearts are often stirred to motions swifter and more impetuous  than the waves that the God of the Sea governs with his trident; and  so, my friend, let none be proud!
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Can you listen, will you understand, if I tell you of my long sickness  of grief?
-----
Accept me as I present myself, and consider that it is better to die  because one has lived than to live because one never lived!
-----
Envy not  the carefree, the wooden images who want nothing because their  souls are so lacking in everything, who do not ask if the sun will  shine or the rain fall, because they have nothing to cultivate.
-----
Yes: yes!
-----
it is very easy indeed to be happy and at peace, with a  shallow heart and a narrow mind.
-----
Let them enjoy it; who goes into a  passion if the wooden target does not cry when the arrow strikes it,  if the empty pot gives such a hollow sound when someone throws it  against the wall?
-----
Only, dear people, you must resign yourselves, and hold your  tongues and wonder, if you cannot understand that others are not so  happy as you are nor so self-satisfied; you must beware of making      your wisdom law, for obedience to you would be the end of the  world« y  I was now living very quietly and unpretentiously in Tina.
-----
I really  succeeded in letting the shows of the world pass by like mists in  autumn, and laughed sometimes too with tears in my eyes—at my  heart, when it went flying off to regale itself like the bird that pecks  at painted grapes, yet I remained unsoured and unperturbed*  I grudged no one his opinions or his improprieties* I was converted, I no longer wished to convert others; it only saddened me when I saw that people believed that I did not interfere with their  clownish behavior because I esteemed it as highly as they did* I was  not willing actually to subject myself to their nonsense, but I tried to  let it pass wherever I could* "It is all the pleasure they have," I  thought, "it is their life!"
-----
Often I was even pleased to join in with them, and yet, however  apathetically and unspontaneously I made the effort, not one of  them ever noticed, not one of them was aware of any lack in me, and  had I asked them to excuse me, they would have stood there wondering and asked: "But what have you done to us?"
-----
What forbearance they showed!
-----
Often in the morning when I stood at my window and the busy  day began to pour in upon me, I could even forget myself for a  moment, I could look about me as if I were going to undertake  something in which my being could still find delight, as once it did;  but then I would rebuke myself, I would recollect myself like one  who inadvertently utters a word of his mother tongue in some  country where no one understands it—"Where are you going, my  heart?"
-----
I enjoined myself prudently, and obeyed*  "What is it for which man so immeasurably longs?"
-----
I often asked  myself; "what is eternity doing in his breast?
-----
Eternity?
-----
Wherei&jt?
-----
who has ever seen it?
-----
Man wants more than he is capable of!
-----
that  seems to be the truth of it!
-----
Oh, you have experienced it often  enough!
-----
And as it is, so it must be* This it is which bestows the  sweet, rapturous sense of power, that our powers do not flow forth as  they will; this it is, and nothing else, which creates our fair dreams of  immortality and all the enticing, all the colossal phantoms that  ravish men a thousand times over; this it is which creates his  Elysium and his gods for man, that die line of his life does not run    3  straight, that he does not speed to his goal like an arrow, that a  power outside of him stops him in his flight.
-----
"The heat's surging wave would not foam up so beautifully and  become spirit, did not the ancient cliff of Fate stand silendy opposing it.
-----
"Yet, even so, the impulse dies in our breast, and with it our gods  and their heaven.
-----
"The fire leaps up in shapes of joy from the dark cradle in which it  slept, and its flame rises and falls, is gone and comes laughing back  again, until that on which it fed is consumed; now it smokes and  struggles and dies; what remains is ashes.
-----
"So it is with us.
-----
This is the heart of all that the wise teach us in  forbidding and enticing mysteries.
-----
"And you?
-----
why do you concern yourself?
-----
That now and again  something rises up in you, and in one instant, like a dying man's mouth, your heart opens itself to you with such power and closes  again—that is precisely the fatal symptom.
-----
"Only be still and let things take their course!
-----
Stop devising!
-----
Stop  childishly trying to add a foot to your height!—It is as if you wanted  to create another sun and new creatures for it to nourish, to bring  forth an earth and a moon."
-----
So I dreamed on.
-----
Patiently, little by little, I took leave of everything.—O you who live in this age with me!
-----
seek not counsel of your doctors nor of your priests when your hearts wither away!
-----
You have lost all faith in anything great; you are doomed, then,  doomed to perish, unless that faith returns, like a comet from  unknown skies.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  There is a forgetting of all existence, a hush of our being, in which  we feel as if we had found everything.
-----
There is a hush, a forgetting of all existence, in which we feel as if  we had lost everything, a night of our soul, in which no glimmer of  any star nor even the fire from a rotting log gives us light.
-----
I had become quiet.
-----
No longer did anything drive me from bed at  midnight.
-----
No longer did I singe myself in my own flame.
-----
Now I looked straight before me, alone and impassive, nor did  my eyes roam over the past and the future.
-----
No longer now did far  and near jostle together in my mind.
-----
Unless men forced me I did not  see them.
-----
Once this century lay before my mind's eye like the eternally  empty cask of the Danaides, and my soul poured itself out with  c prodigal love, to fill the void; now I saw no more void, now the ennui of life no longer oppressed me.
-----
Never now did I say to the flower, "You are my sister," and to the  springs, "We are of one race."
-----
Now, like an echo, I faithfully gave each thing its name.
-----
Like a river past arid banks, where no willow leaf mirrors itself in  the water, the world flowed past me untouched by beauty.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Nothing can grow, nothing so utterly wither away, like man.
-----
He  often compares his woe with the darkness of the abyss, his bliss with  die ether, and how little does that tell of either?
-----
But nothing is more beautiful than when, after a long death, it  begins to dawn in him and sorrow goes like a brother to meet  distantly dawning joy.
-----
Oh, it was with a heavenly anticipation that I now greeted the  returning spring!
-----
Like the far music of the beloved's lyre in windless  air when all is asleep, so spring's soft melodies sounded about my  breast; as if from distant Elysium, so I felt its coining, when the dead  twigs stirred and a soft air brushed my cheek.
-----
Lovely sky of Ionia!
-----
Never had I so looked to you; but never had  my heart been so like you as dien in its playful gaiety, its playful  tenderness.—  Who does not long for the joys of love and for high deeds when  spring returns to die eye of Heaven and the bosom of Earth?
-----
I rose as from a sickbed, quietly and slowly, but my breast  trembled so blissfully with secret hopes that I quite forgot to ask  what this might mean.
-----
More beautiful dreams now wrapped me when I slept, and when  I woke they were in my heart, like die trace of a kiss on the cheek of    3  the beloved.
-----
Oh!
-----
the morning light and I—we went to meet each  other now like newly reconciled friends when they still hold back  and yet already bear in their souls the coming, endless moment of  their embrace.
-----
Now once again my eye truly opened—not, to be sure, as once it  did, armed and filled with strength from within me; it had become  more entreating, it begged for life, but in my heart of hearts it was as  if I could be again what once I had been, and better.
-----
I looked at men again as if I, too, was to work among them and  rejoice with them.
-----
I cordially and sincerely committed myself everywhere.
-----
Heavens!
-----
what a sight for them to gloat over—the proud nonconformist brought low, become one of themselves!
-----
What a joke: the wild deer of the forest driven by hunger to come running into their  barnyard!—  Ah!
-----
I looked for my Adamas, for my Alabanda, but neither erf  them appeared to me.
-----
Finally, I even wrote to Smyrna, and, as I wrote, it was as if all the  tenderness and all the strength of humanity were concentrated in  that one moment; three times I wrote thus, but no answer came, I  implored, threatened, evoked all our hours of love and courage, but  no answer came from him of imperishable memory, from him whom  I loved beyond life—"Alabanda!"
-----
I cried, "O my Alabanda!
-----
you  have pronounced my death sentence.
-----
You kept me from falling, you  were the last hope of my youth!
-----
Now I want nothing more, now it is  sworn and sealed!"
-----
We pity the dead as if they felt death, yet the dead have peace.
-----
But  the pain, the pain that no pain equals, is the incessant feeling of utter  annihilation when our life loses its meaning, when our heart bids  itself "Down!
-----
into the depths!
-----
there is nothing left of you; you have  planted no flower, built no hut, so that you might but say: I leave a  trace behind me on earth."
-----
Yet, oh!
-----
the soul can always be so full erf  longing, even when it is so cast down!
-----
I still sought for something, but I did not dare to raise my eyes in  the presence of men.
-----
I went through hours when I feared the  laughter of a child.
-----
Yet for the most part I was perfectly quiet and patient, I even had a      strangely superstitious belief in the healing power of many things,  from a dove that I bought, a row that I took, a valley that the  mountains hid from me, from these I could hope for comfort«  Enough!
-----
enough!
-----
Had I grown up with Themistocles, had I lived  among the Scipios, my soul would never have come to know itself in  this light.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  At times some energy would even yet waken in my spirit.
-----
But only  for destruction!
-----
What is man?—so I might begin; how does it happen that the  world contains such a thing, which ferments like a chaos or  moulders like a rotten tree, and never grows to ripeness?
-----
How can  Nature tolerate this sour grape among her sweet clusters?
-----
To the plants he says: I, too, was once like you!
-----
and to the pure  stars: I shall become like you in another world!—meanwhile he M s  to pieces and keeps practicing his arts on himself as if, once it had  come apart, he could put a living thing together again like a piece of  masonry; but it does not disconcert him if nothing is the better for  all his efforts; yet what he does will always be but artifice.
-----
Oh, you wretches who feel all this, who, even as I, cannot allow  yourselves to speak of man's being here for a purpose, who, even as  I, are so utterly in the clutch of the Nothing that governs us, so  profoundly aware that wejare born for nothing, that we lqyea  nothing, believe in nothing, work ourselves to death for nothing only  "that little by little we may pass over into nothing—how can I heiß jt  if your knees collapse when you think of it seriously?
-----
Many a time  Tiave I, too, sunk into these bottomless thoughts, and cried out: Why  do you lay the axe to my root, pitiless spirit?—and still I am here.
-----
Oh, once, my brothers in darkness, it was otherwise.
-----
Then all was  so fair above us, all so fair and joyous before us; our hearts, too,  overflowed before the distant, blessed phantoms, our spirits, too,  strove upward bold and exulting and broke the barriers—and, when  they looked about, alas, there was only endless emptiness.
-----
Oh, I can fall to my knees and wring my hands and pray—but to    3  whom?—for other thoughts.
-----
But I cannot overcome it, the screaming truth.
-----
Have I not twice convinced myself?
-----
When I look at life, what is last of all?
-----
Nothing.
-----
When I arise in spirit, what is highest of  all?
-----
Nothing.
-----
But be still, my heart!
-----
This is your last strength that you are  wasting!
-----
Your last strength?
-----
and you—you would storm heaven?
-----
then where are your hundred arms, Titan, where your Felion and  Ossa, your stairway to the city of the Father of the Gods, that you  may climb it and throw down the God and his divine banquet and  the summit of Olympus, and preach to mortals: Remain below,  children of the moment!
-----
seek not to reach these heights, for there is  nothing here above.
-----
You may well leave off watching what governs others, my heart*  Your new knowledge is meant for you.
-----
Sure enough, before you and  above you there is emptiness and desolation, because there is emptiness and desolation within you.
-----
To be sure, if you other men are richer than I am, you might just  help a little.
-----
If your garden is so full of flowers, why does not their breath  rejoice me too?—If you are so filled with divinity, give me to drink of  it.
-----
At feasts no one starves, not even the poorest.
-----
But only one holds his feast among you: that is Death.
-----
Sorrow and Fear and Darkness are your lords.
-----
They separate you,  they drive you together with blows.
-----
You call hunger love, and where  you see nothing more, there dwell your gods.
-----
Gods and love?
-----
Oh, the poets are right, there is nothing so little and of so little  account that man could not know rapture by it.
-----
So I thought.
-----
How all this came to be in me, I still do not  understand.
-----
Book Two  Hyperion to Bellarmin  I now live on Ajax's island, dear Salamis.
-----
I love all of this Greece.
-----
It wears the color of my heart.
-----
Wherever you look, a joy lies buried.
-----
And yet there is so much that is delightful, so much that is great,  about one.
-----
On the promontory I have built a hut of mastic branches, and  planted moss and trees about it, and thyme and every kind of shrub.
-----
There I spend my favorite hours, there I sit evening after long  evening, gazing across at Attica, until finally my heart beats too  strongly; then I gather up my gear, go down to the bay, and catch  fish.
-----
Or, up on my hill, I read of the ancient, magnificent sea fight that  once blazed up at Salamis in wild but skillfully controlled confusion, and I rejoice in the mind that could guide and master the fierce chaos of friends and foes as a rider does his horse, and I feel  deeply ashamed of my own career as a soldier.
-----
Or I gaze out over die sea and reflect upon my life, its heights and  its depths, its bliss and its sorrow, and often my past comes back to  me like the sound of a lyre on which the master runs through every  tone, blending discord and harmony in obedience to a hidden plan.
-----
Today up here it is especially beautiful.
-----
Two gracious days of rain  have cooled the air and the weary earth.
-----
The ground has turned greener, the fields are more open.
-----
The  golden wheat stands endless, mingled with joyful cornflowers, and a  thousand hopeful crowns rise from the depth of the grove.
-----
Each faint  or bold line of the distance is conveyed through space; one behind  the other, the mountains rise unbroken to the sun, like a flight of  steps.
-----
The whole sky is pure.
-----
The white light is but breathed over the  ether, and like a little silver cloud the shy moon goes floating across  the bright day.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  It is long since I have been as now I am.
-----
As Jupiter's eagle listens for the song of the Muses, so I listen for  the marvelous, unending euphony in me.
-----
Undisturbed in mind and  soul, strong and joyous and smilingly serious, I play with Bate and  the Three Sisters, die holy.
-----
Parcae.
-----
Rill of divine youth, my whole  being rejoices over itself, over all things.
-----
Like the starry Iky, I am  calm and moved.
-----
3  I have waited long for such a holiday time, that I might write to  you once again.
-----
Now I am strong enough; now let me tell on.
-----
In the midst of my dark days, a friend from Calaurea invited me  over to visit him.
-----
I must come to his mountains, he insisted; life  there was freer than anywhere else, and there, too, amid the  pinewoods and the enchanting streams, there were lemon groves  and palms and lovely herbage and myrtles and the sacred grape.
-----
He  had planted a garden high in the mountains and built a house;  close-set trees shaded it from behind, and cooling airs played softly  about it in the burning days of summer; from it, like a bird from the  top of a cedar, one looked down into the low country, over die  villages and green hills and peaceful homes of the island, lying like  children about the glorious mountain and drawing their nourishment from its foaming brooks.
-----
That roused me a little, even then.
-----
It was on a bright, blue April  day that I sailed over.
-----
The sea was unusually beautiful and pure, the  air as light as in higher regions.
-----
In the gliding bark we left the earth  behind, as one leaves a delicious dish when the sacred wine is  handed round.
-----
My dark moods strove in vain against the influence of sea and air.
-----
I surrendered myself, cared neither about myself no^others, sought  for nothing, thought of nothing, let the boat rock me half asleep, and  imagined that I was lying in Charon's bark.
-----
Oh, it is sweet so to  drink from the cup of oblivion.
-----
My cheerful skipper wanted to strike up a conversation with me,  but I was very monosyllabic  He kept pointing to islands right and left, but I did not look long,  and the next minute I was back in my own sweet dreams.
-----
Hnally when he pointed out quiet peaks in the distance and said  that we should soon reach Calaurea, I became more attentive, and  my whole being opened to the marvelous power that, sweet and still  and inexplicable, suddenly played upon me.
-----
Wide-eyed, astonished  and happy, I gazed out into the secrets of the distance, my heart  trembled a little, my hand escaped me and hastened to grasp my  skipper affectionately.—"What!"
-----
I cried, "is that Calaurea?"
-----
And as he turned to look at me in surprise, I was myself at a loss what to  make of myself.
-----
I greeted my friend with the greatest fondness.
-----
My whole being  was full of sweet unrest.
-----
That very afternoon I set out to explore part of the island.
-----
The  woods and secret valleys attracted me indescribably, and the charming day lured everything out.
-----
It was so plain to see that all living things crave more than daily  bread, that die bird, too, has its festal banquet, and the beast  It was enchanting to look at!
-----
As when a mother cajolingly asks  where her dearest pet has got to, and all her children come rushing  to her lap and even the littlest reaches out its arms from the cradle,  so every life flew and leaped and struggled out into the divine air,  and beedes and swallows and doves and storks circled together in  joyous confusion in its depths and heights, and the steps of all that  were earthbound became flight, the horse charged over the furrows  and the deer over the hedges, die fish came up from the bottom of  the sea and leaped over die surface.
-----
The motherly air affected the  hearts of all, uplifted all and drew them to her.
-----
And men came out erf their doors, and wonderfully did they feel  the ethereal breeze as it lighdy moved the fine hairs over their  foreheads, as it cooled the sun's ray, and happily they loosed their  garments to receive it upon their chests, and breathed more sweedy,  felt more gendy touched by the light, cool, soothing sea in which  they lived and moved and had their being.
-----
0 Sister of the spirit that lives in us and rules us with fiery power,  holy Air!
-----
how beautiful it is that, no matter where I wander, you  accompany me, all-present, immortal one!
-----
It was with the children that the high element played most beautifully.
-----
One hummed happily to himself, a litde rhythmless song rose  from another's lips, a shout of joy from another's open throat; one  stretched, one leaped high; another strolled about, lost to the world.
-----
And all this was the language of a single sense of well-being, all was one answer to the caresses of the ravishing breezes.
-----
1 was filled with indescribable longing and peace.
-----
An uncanny  power ruled me.
-----
Kindly Spirit, I said to myself, where are you calling  me?
-----
to Elysium, or where?
-----
I went up through a wood, following purling waters as, here, they  trickled down a cliff, there glided innocently over pebbles; and litde  by litde the valley grew narrower and became an arcade, and the  light of high noon played solitary in the still darkness—    4  Here—would that I could speak, my Bellarmin!
-----
would that I  could write to you calmly.
-----
Speak?
-----
Oh, I am a novice in joy, I want to speak!
-----
Does not silence dwell in the Land of the Blessed?
-----
Above the stars  the heart forgets its needs and its language.
-----
I have guarded it sacredly!
-----
I have carried it within me like a  palladium—the divine that appeared to me!
-----
and if henceforth Fate  lays hold of me and casts me from abyss to abyss and drowns all  powers in me and all thoughts: yet shall this unique revelation  outlive myself in me and shine in me and rule me, in eternal,  indestructible brightness!—  So did you lie poured out, sweet life, so did you look up, and arise,  and stand there before me in delicate completeness, divinely calm,  and with your heavenly face filled with the serene ecstasy in which I  disturbed you!
-----
Oh, he who has looked into the stillness of those eyes, he for  whom those sweet lips have opened—of what else can he speak?
-----
Peace of beauty!
-----
divine peace!
-----
he whose raging life, whose doubting spirit, has once been soothed by you, what else can avail him?
-----
I cannot speak of her; but there are hours when the best and most  beautiful appears as in clouds, and the heaven of crowning perfection opens before the surmise of love; in such a moment, Bellarmin, think of her being, in such a moment go down on your knees with  me and think of my bliss!
-----
but forget not that I had what you only  surmise, that I saw with these eyes what appears to you only as in  clouds.
-----
That men will sometimes say they are happy!
-----
Oh, believe me, you  who speak thus, you have had no faintest inkling of what happiness  is!
-----
Not the shadow of its shadow has yet appeared to you!
-----
O  blindmen, depart, and speak not of the blue ether!
-----
That one can become as children are, that still the golden age of  innocence returns, the time of peace and freedom, that one happiness, one place of rest remains upon earth!
-----
Does not man grow old and shrivelled, is he not like a fallen leaf  that finds not its branch again and is driven here and there by the  winds, until the sand buries it?
-----
And yet his spring returns!
-----
Weep not, when the best fades, it will soon revive!
-----
Mourn not,      when the melody of your hearts falls silent, soon will a hand be  found to tune it again!
-----
How was it with me, then?
-----
Was I not like a shattered lyre?
-----
I  sounded a little still, but they were tones of death.
-----
I had sung a  mournful swan song for myself!
-----
Gladly would I have woven myself a  funeral wreath, but I had only winter flowers.
-----
And where, then, was it now—-the deathly silence, the darkness  and emptiness of my life?
-----
all that paltry mortality?
-----
True enough, life is wretched and lonely.
-----
We live here below like  the diamond in the mine.
-----
In vain we ask where we went astray, that  we may find the way upward again.
-----
We are like fire that sleeps in the dry branch or in the coal, and  ever we struggle and seek for an end to our cramped confinement.
-----
But they come, they make up for aeons of struggle, the moments  when we are set free, when the divine shatters the prison, when the  flame bursts from the wood and flies up over the ashes, ah!
-----
when it  is with us as if, its sorrows and its servitude forgotten, the unshackled spirit were returning in triumph to the halls of the Sun.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Once I was happy, Bellarmin!
-----
Am I not so still?
-----
Should I not be  happy even if the sacred moment when first I saw her had been the  last?
-----
I have seen it once, the one thing that my soul sought, and the  perfection that we put somewhere far away above the stars, that we  put off until the end of time—I have felt it in its living presence.
-----
There it was, all that is highest!
-----
in this circle of human nature and of  things, it was there!
-----
I no longer ask where it may be; it was in the world, it can return  into it, it is in the world now, only more hidden.
-----
I no longer ask  what it is; I have seen it, have known it.
-----
O you who seek the highest and the best, whether in the depths of  knowledge, in the turmoil of action, in the darkness of the past, in  the labyrinth of the future, in graves or above the stars!
-----
do you know  its name?
-----
the name of that which is one and is all?
-----
Its name is Beauty.
-----
4  Did you know what you were looking for?
-----
I know it not yet, but I  surmise it as from afar, the new kingdom of the new divinity, and I  hasten toward it and seize upon others and take them with me, as  the river the rivers to the ocean.
-----
And you, you showed me the way!
-----
With you I began.
-----
They are not  worth speech, the days when yet I knew you not—  O Diotima, Diotima, divine being!
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Let us forget that time exists and cease to reckon the days of our  lives!
-----
What are centuries compared to the moment when two beings  thus divine and approach each other?
-----
I still see the evening when Notara took me to visit her for the first  time.
-----
She lived only a few hundred paces from us, at the foot of the  mountain.
-----
Her mother was a thoughtful, tender being, her brother a simple,  happy lad, and both of them, in all that they did, gladly acknowl-  edged that Diotima was the queen of the household.
-----
Ah, everything was blessed and beautified by her presence.
-----
Wher-  ever I looked, whatever I touched, the rug beside her chair, her  cushion, her little table—they were all mysteriously allied to her.
-----
And, oh, the first time she addressed me by my name, that she came  so close to me that her innocent breath touched my listening  being!—  We spoke to each other very little.
-----
Speech abashes.
-----
Music alone  would serve: to become all music and umted with each other in one  celestial melody!
-----
And of what were we to speak?
-----
We saw nothing but each other.
-----
Of  that we did not dare to speak.
-----
In the end we spoke of the life of the Earth.
-----
Never has a hymn at once so ardent and so childlike been sung to  her.
-----
It did us good to bestrew our kindly Mother's lap with what  overbrimmed our hearts.
-----
We felt relieved, as the trees do when the      summer wind shakes their fruitful branches and pours their sweet  apples over the grass.
-----
We called Earth one of the flowers of Heaven, and Heaven the  infinite garden of life.
-----
As roses gladden one another with golden  dust, we said, even so does the heroic sunlight gladden Earth with its  rays; she is a glorious living being, we said, alike divine when raging  fire or sweet clear water pours from her heart; even happy, whether  she be nourished by dewdrops, or by thunderclouds that she prepares for her delight with the sky's aid; she is the ever more faithfully loving mate of the Sun God, perhaps in the beginning  more intimately united with him but then divided from him by some  all-powerful Fate, so that now she seeks him, approaches him, draws  away, and, between joy and sorrow, ripens to die highest beauty.
-----
So we spoke.
-----
I give you the gist, the essence of it.
-----
But what is that  without the life?
-----
Twilight fell, it was time to go.
-----
"Good night, you angel eyes!"
-----
I  thought in my heart.
-----
"Appear to me soon again, you beautiful,  divine spirit, with your peace and your abundance!"
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Some days later they came up to visit us.
-----
We walked about the  garden together.
-----
Diotima and I found ourselves ahead of the others,  absorbed; tears of ecstasy often rose to my eyes for the holiness that  walked so unpretentiously beside me.
-----
Now we were standing close to the summit's rim, gazing out into  the endless East  Diotima's eyes opened wide, and softly, as a bud unfolds, that  sweet face unfolded under the airs of heaven, became pure speech  and soul, and, as if beginning to rise among the clouds, her whole  figure stood drawn gracefully up in gende majesty, her feet scarcely  touching the ground.
-----
Oh, could I have caught her under the arms, as the eagle grasps  his Ganymede, and flown away with her over the sea and the islands!
-----
Now she stepped yet farther forward, and gazed down the precipitous rock wall.
-----
She found a pleasure in gauging the terrifying depths and losing herself in die night of the woods that raised their    4  lustrous crowns from among fallen rocks and foaming, storm-  swollen streams.
-----
The balustrade against which she was leaning was rather low.
-----
So I  dared to hold the charming being a moment, while thus she leaned  forward.
-----
Ah!
-----
hot, trembling rapture coursed through my being, my  every sense reeled and was confounded, my hands burned like coals,  when I touched her.
-----
And then the profound joy of standing so familiarly beside her,  and my tender, childish fear that she might fall, and my delight in  the glorious maiden's enthusiasm!
-----
What is all that men have done and thought over thousands of  years, compared with one moment of love?
-----
But in all Nature, too, it is what is nearest to perfection, what is most divinely beautiful!
-----
There all stairs lead from the threshold of life.
-----
From there we come,  to there we go.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  The one thing that I should forget is her singing, only that music  from the soul should never return into my unending dreams.
-----
We do not know the proudly sailing swan when it sits asleep on  the bank.
-----
Only when she sang could one know the sweet, silent one who  was so reluctant to speak.
-----
Only then did that divinely uncomplaisant maiden appear in her  majesty and her charm; then, then did her tender, blossoming lips  breathe now cajolery and flattery, now the sternness of a divine  decree.
-----
And what a quickened heart there was in that divine voice,  how all pride and all humility, all the joy and sorrow of life appeared  beautified in the nobility of those tones!
-----
As the swallow catches bees in flight, so she ever seized us all.
-----
It was not delight, not wonder that arose among us, it was the  peace of heaven.
-----
A thousand times have I said it to her and to myself: the most  beautiful is also the most sacred.
-----
And such was everything in her.
-----
Like her singing, even so was her life.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Her heart was at home among flowers, as if it were one of them.
-----
She named them all by their names, or out of her love for them  gave them new and more beautiful ones, she knew exactly which was  die happiest season for each of them.
-----
Like a sister when a dear brother or sister comes running to her  from every corner, and each would be greeted first, so was her quiet  being busy with hand and eye, blissfully distracted, when we walked  to the meadows or the woods.
-----
And all this was so utterly unaffected and uncalculated in her, it  was so much a part of her own growth.
-----
It is eternally true, it is visible everywhere: the more innocent, the  more beautiful a soul is, the more familiarly will it live with those  other happy beings to which men deny souls.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  A thousand times in the joy of my heart have I laughed at people  who imagine that a noble spirit cannot possibly know how to cook a  vegetable.
-----
At the proper time Diotima could speak stoudy of the  hearth, and surely there is nothing nobler than a noble maiden who  tends die all-beneficent flame and, like Nature herself, prepares the  food that gladdens the heart.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  -\ .
-----
,- >  What is all the artful knowledge in the world, what is all the proud  autonomy of human thought, compared with the unstudied music  of this spirit, which knew not what it knew or what it was?
-----
Who would not rather choose the full, fresh grape-cluster as it  sprang from the root, than the picked and dried grapes that the  merchant presses into a box and sends out into the world?
-----
What is  the wisdom of a book compared with the wisdom of an angel?
-----
She always seemed to say so little, and said so much.
-----
4  One late twilight I was taking her home; like dreams, dewy mists  were gliding over the fields, the blessed stars looked down through  the twigs like watchful spirits«  Rarely was a "How beautiful !"
-----
heard from her lips, even though  her reverent heart left no whispering lea£ no purling brook unheard  and unheeded.
-----
But this time she said it aloud to me: "How beautiful!"
-----
"Perhaps it is so to please us!"
-----
I said casually, as children say  something, neither in jest nor in earnest.
-----
"I can imagine that it is as you say," she answered; "I like best to think of the world as of life in a household of which each member,  without exactly thinking about it, adapts himself to all the others, in  which all live pleasing and rejoicing one another simply because that  is what springs from their hearts."
-----
"A happy and noble truth!"
-----
I cried.
-----
She was silent for a while.
-----
"Then we, too, are children in such a household," I finally resumed; "we are, and shall be."
-----
"Shall ever be," she answered.
-----
"Shall we?"
-----
I asked.
-----
"In this," she continued, "I trust Nature, as daily I trust her."
-----
Oh, how I wished that I could have been Diotima as she said this!
-----
But you do not know what she said, my Bellarmin!
-----
You neither saw  it nor heard it.
-----
"You are right," I cried.
-----
"Eternal Beauty—Nature—suffers no loss  as she suffers no addition.
-----
Her ornaments are different tomorrow  from what they were today; but she cannot dispense with what is  best in us, with us, with us ourselves, and least of all with you.
-----
We  believe that we are eternal because our souls feel the beauty of  Nature.
-----
She will be a mere patchwork, she will be neither divine nor  complete, if ever you are lacking to her.
-----
She does not deserve your  heart if she must blush before your hopes."
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Such freedom from wants, such divine content I have never found  before.
-----
As the ocean swell about the shores of happy islands, so the peace  of die heavenly maiden flowed about my restless heart.
-----
I had nothing to give her except a mind full of wild contradictions, full of bleeding memories, I had nothing to give her except my boundless love with its thousand cares, its thousand furious hopes;  but she stood before me in changeless beauty, effortless, in smiling  perfection, and all the visions, all the dreams of mortality, ah!
-----
all  that the Genius presages of higher regions in golden morning  hours—it was all fulfilled in that one calm soul.
-----
Men say that the battle will die away beyond the stars; only after  our lees have sunk, they promise us, will fermenting life be changed  into the noble vintage of joy; men look no more on this earth for the  heart-whole rest of the blessed.
-----
I know otherwise.
-----
I have taken the  shorter way.
-----
I stood before her, and heard and saw the peace of  Heaven, and in the very midst of this sighing chaos, Urania appeared  to me.
-----
How often have I stilled my grieving before that image!
-----
how often  have arrogant life and the striving mind been pacified when, sunk in  blessed contemplation, I looked into her heart, as one looks into a  spring when it trembles silently under the touch of the sky that  trickles down on it in drops of silver!
-----
She was my Lethe, her soul my sacred Lethe, from which I drank  forgetfulness of existence, so that I stood before her like an immortal  and joyously rebuked myself and, as if after oppressive dreams,  could not but smile at all the chains that had hung heavy on me.
-----
Oh, I could have become a happy man, an admirable man with  her!
-----
With her!
-----
But that failed, and now I wander about in what is  before me and in me, and beyond, and know not what to make of  myself and other things.
-----
My soul is like a fish cast up out of its element on the sand of the  beach, and it writhes and flings itself about until it dries up in the  heat of the day.
-----
Ah!
-----
were there but something left in the world for me to do!
-----
were  there work for me, a war for me—that would refresh me!
-----
Boys torn from their mother's breasts and cast out into the wilderness were once, so they say, suckled by a she-wol£  My heart is not so fortunate.
-----
4  i  Hyperion to Bellarmin  I can speak only here and there a word about hen I have to forget  what she is in her completeness if I am to speak of her at all.
-----
I have to  trick myself into believing that she lived long, long ago, that I know  only a little about her from hearsay, if her living image is not so to  overwhelm me that I perish in rapture and woe, if I am not to die of  delight in her and die of grief for her.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  It is in vain; I cannot hide it from myselt Wherever I flee with my  thoughts, be it up to the heavens or into the abyss, to the beginning  and to the end of Time, even if I turn to that which was my last  refuge, which consumed every other grief in me, which burned up  every other joy and woe of life for me in the flame in which it  revealed itself, even if I cast myself into the arms of that glorious,  secret Spirit of the World, plunge into its depths as into the boundless ocean—there, even there the sweet terror finds me, the sweet, bewildering, fatal terror, that Diotima's grave is near me.
-----
Do you hear?
-----
do you hear?
-----
Diotima's grave!
-----
Yet my heart had grown so quiet, and my love was buried with the  dead one whom I loved.
-----
You know, my Bellarmin, that for a long time I did not write to  you of her, and when I wrote, I wrote to you calmly, or so I think?
-----
So what is it now?
-----
I go down to the shore and look across to Calaurea, where she  rests—it is that.
-----
Oh, may no one lend me his boat, may no one have pity on me  and offer me his oars and take me across to her!
-----
May the kindly sea not remain calm, that I may not cut myself a  piece of wood and swim across to her.
-----
But let me plunge into the  raging sea and ask its waves to cast me on Diotima's shore!
-----
Dear brother!
-----
I comfort my heart with all sorts of imaginings, I  pour myself many a sleeping potion; and surely it would be nobler  to free oneself forever than to make do with palliatives; but who  does not do likewise?
-----
So I am content to have it so.
-----
Content!
-----
that would be a fine thing!
-----
that would be the help that is  needed where no god can help.
-----
Now, now!
-----
I have done what I could!
-----
I call on late to give me back  my sold.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Was she not mine, you Sisters of Roe, was she not mine?
-----
I summon  the pure springs to witness, and the innocent trees that saw and  heard us, and the light of day and the ether!
-----
was she not mine?
-----
at  one with me in all the tones of life?
-----
Where is the being that knew her as mine did?
-----
In what mirror, as  in me, were all the rays of that light concentrated?
-----
was she not  joyously terrified by her own splendor when first she became conscious of it in my joy?
-----
Ah!
-----
where is the heart that filled her and was filled by her like mine, that existed only to embrace hers, as the  eyelash exists for the eye.
-----
We were but one flower, and our souls lived in each other, like the flower when it loves and hides its tender joys in its closed cup.
-----
And yet, and yet, was she not torn from me like a crown usurped,  and laid in the dust?
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Before either of us knew it, we belonged to each other.
-----
When, with all the homage of my heart, blissfully conquered, I  stood before her, saying nothing, and all my life offered itself up in  the gaze of my eyes that saw only her, embraced only her, and she in  turn looked at me in tender uncertainty, not knowing where my  thoughts had come to rest; when often, absorbed in delight and  beauty, I watched her at some charming task, and about her slightest  movement, as the bee about the swaying twig, my soul darted and  flew, and when then she turned to me in calm thought, and, startled  by my joy, had to hide my joy from herself, and sought for peace in  her dear task again, and found it—    S  When in her miraculous omniscience, she caught every harmony,  every dissonance in the depths of my being and revealed diem to me  before I was even aware of them, when she saw every shadow of a  cloud on my brow, every shadow of melancholy, of pride, on my lips,  every^spark in my eyes, when she listened for the ebb and flow of my  heart, and sadly foreboded troubled hours as my spirit spent itself  too intemperately and prodigally in exuberant speeches, when the  dear being showed me every change in my face more faithfully than a  mirror, and often in loving concern reproved me for my unstable  being and scolded me as one scolds a cherished child—  Ah!
-----
when once, innocent being, you counted on your fingers the  steps that led down from our mountain to your house, when you  showed me your walks, the places where you had often sat, and told  me how the hours had passed for you then, and said at last that now  it seemed to you as if I had always been there t o o -  Had we not then long since belonged to each other?
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  I dig my heart a grave, that it may rest; I spin a cocoon about myself,  because it is winter everywhere; I wrap myself against the storm in  blissful memories.
-----
One day we were sitting in Diotima's garden under blossoming  almond trees, with Notara (that was the name of the friend in whose  house I was living) and a few others who, like ourselves, were among  the nonconformists in Calaurea, talking, among other things, about  friendship.
-----
I had scarcely joined in the conversation; for some time I had  avoided saying much about things that lie closest to the heart, so  taciturn had my Diotima made me.—  "When Harmodius.and Aristogiton were alive," someone cried at  last, "friendship „still existed, in the world," That pleased me too  much for me to remain silent.
-----
"We should twine you a wreath in reward for those words!"
-----
I  cried.
-----
"But have you really any notion, any image, of the friendship  between Aristogiton and Harmodius?
-----
Forgive me!
-----
But, by the      Ether!
-----
one must be Aristogiton to have a sense of how Aristogiton  loved, and surely he must not fear lightning who would be loved  with Harmodius?
-----
love, for I am mistaken in everything if the terrible  youth did not love with all the sternness of Minos.
-----
Few have come off  successfully in such a test, and it is no easier to be the friend of a  demigod than, like Tantalus, to sit at the table of the gods.
-----
But by  the same token there is nothing more glorious on earth than when  such a proud pair as they are so sovereign over each other.
-----
"This is my hope, too, my longing and my joy in solitary hours,  that such noble tones, yes, and nobler, must yet sound again in the  symphony of the world's course.
-----
Love brought to birth millenniums  filled with living men; friendship will give birth to them again.
-----
Once  upon a time the peoples set forth from the harmony of childhood;  the harmony of spirits will be the beginning of another history of  man.
-----
Men began and grew from the happiness of the plant, grew  until they ripened; from that time on they have been in ceaseless  ferment, inwardly and outwardly, until now mankind lies there like  a Chaps, utterly disintegrated, so thai ajT who can still feel and see  are dizzied; but Beauty forsakes die life of men, flees upward into  Spirit; the Ideal becomes what Nature was, and even though the tree  is dried out and weatherworn below, a fresh crown has still sprung  from it and flourishes green in the sunlight as the trunk did once in  itsjiays of youth; the Ideal is what Nature was.
-----
By this, by; this Ideal,  this rejuvenated divinity, the few recognize one another and are one,  föFöne thing is in them; and from them, from them, the world's  second age begins—1 have said enough to make it clearj#hajJL  think;*  -You should hare seen Diotima then, springing up and giving me  both her hands and crying: "I have understood it, beloved, much as  it means, understood it all.
-----
"Love bore the world, friendship will bear it again.
-----
"Therefore, O you of the future, you new Dioscuri, therefore  linger a little when you pass by the place where Hyperion sleeps,  linger in sympathy over the forgotten man's ashes, and say: He  would be like one of us, were he here now."
-----
This I heard, my Bellarmin!
-----
this was granted to me, and shall I not  willingly go to my death?
-----
5  Yes!
-----
yes!
-----
I have already had my reward; I have lived.
-----
A god could  bear more joy, but not I.  Hyperion to Bellarmin  Do you ask how it was with me at that time?
-----
As with one who has  lost all to gain all.
-----
To be sure, I often came from Diotima's trees like one intoxicated  with victory, often I had to hurry away from her lest I betray any of  my thoughts; so did joy rage in me, and my pride and my boundless  rapture in believing that Diotima loved me.
-----
Then I sought out the highest mountains and their air, and like  the eagle whose bleeding pinion has healed, my spirit moved in  freedom, spread itself over the vi^le wgrldas^jt the world belonged  tgxit; stränge to tell, I often felt asif the things erf earth were purified  and fused together like gold in my fire, and something divine arose  from them and me, so did joy rage in me; and oh!
-----
how I picked up  the children and clasped them to my throbbing heart!
-----
how I greeted  the plants and the trees!
-----
I could have wished that I possessed a spell  to gather all the shy deer and the wild birds of the forest like a happy  family about my prodigal hands—in such blissful folly did I love all  things!
-----
But not for long, and all this was extinguished in me like a light,  and speechless and mournful as a shade I sat and sought for the life  that had vanished.
-----
I felt no wish to complain, no wish to console  myself.
-----
I cast away hope as a lame man casts away his broken crutch;  I was ashamed to weep; I was ashamed to exist.
-----
Yet in the end my  pride burst out in tears,' and the pain that 1 would have disowned  became dear to me, and I took it to my breast like a child.
-----
"No," cried my heart, "no, my Diotima!
-----
it does not hurt.
-----
Preserve your peace, and let me go my way.
-----
Let it not disturb your quietude,  pure star!
-----
that there is ferment and murk below you.
-----
"Oh, let not your rose fade, blessed springtime of the gods!
-----
Let  not your beauty age in the trials of earth.
-----
This, this is my joy, sweet  life!
-----
that you bear carefree Heaven within you.
-----
You are not made to  become a pauper, no, no, you shall not see yourself destitute of  love."
-----
And when again I went down to her—I would have liked to ask  the breeze and try to divine from the drift of the clouds how it would  be with me in an hour!
-----
And how happy I was when some friendly  face met me on the way and called "A lovely day!"
-----
to me not too  mechanically  When a little girl came out of the woods and held out a bunch of  strawberries for me to buy, but with a look as if she wanted to give  them to me, or when a farmer, sitting in his cherry tree picking as I  passed, called down to me from among the branches and asked if I  would not like a handful to taste—those were good omens to my  superstitious heart!
-----
If one of Diotima's windows stood wide open toward the road by  which I came down, what good that did me!
-----
Perhaps she had been looking out of it not long before.
-----
And nowJ_stood before her, breathless and wavering, and pressed  my crossed arms against my heart that I might not feel its trembling,  and as die swimmer struggles out from the clutching tide, so my  spirit strove and struggled not to drown in endless love.
-----
"What shall we talk about, I wonder?"
-----
I would cry.
-----
"It is often  difficult, finding a subject from which one's thoughts will not stray."
-----
"Are they off into the air again?"
-----
my Diotima answered.
-----
"You  must fasten lead to their wings, or I will tie a string to them as a boy  does to a kite, so that we shall not lose them."
-----
The dear girl was trying to help us both out by jesting, but it was  little use.
-----
"Yes!
-----
yes!"
-----
I cried, "whatever you say, whatever you think best—  shall I read aloud?
-----
Your lute is probably still in tune from yesterday  and I really have nothing to read—"  "You have more than once promised," she said, "to tell me of your life before we came to know each other—will you not do it now?"
-----
"True," I said; my heart plunged into it eagerly, and I told her, as I have told you; of Adamas and my lonely days in Smyrna, of Alabanda and how I was parted from him, and of the strange sickness  that afflicted my being before I came over to Calaurea—"Now you  know all," I told her calmly when I had ended, "now you will find  me less objectionable; now you will say," I added with a smile," 'Do  not laugh at this Vulcan if he limps, for the gods have twice flung  him down from heaven to earth/ "    5  "Be still," she cried in a choked voice, and hid her tears in her  handkerchief, "oh, be still, and do not mock your destiny, your  heart!
-----
for I understand them better than you do.
-----
"Dear—dear Hyperion.
-----
You are indeed hard to help,  "Do you not know," she continued, raising her voice, "do you not  know what you are starving for, the one thing that you lack, what  you are seeking as Alpheus his Arethusa, what you mourn for in all  1 your sorrow?
-----
It did not vanish years ago, it is impossible to say  exactly when it was there, when it went, but it was, it is—it is in you!
-----
It is a better age, that is what you seek, a more beautiful world.
-----
It  was that world alone tRat you embraced in your friends, with them  youj^^JthgEJö^d.
-----
"It rose for you in Adamas; with him it set for you.
-----
In Alabanda  its light appeared to you for die second time, but more fiercely and  searingly, and so it was like midnight about your soul when you  found him gone.
-----
"Now do you see, too, why the least doubt of Alabanda could not  but become despair in you?
-----
why you repudiated him, onlybecause  he was not quite a god?
-----
"It was no man that you wanted, believe me, you wanted a world.
-----
The loss of all golden centuries, crowded together, as you felt them,  in one happy moment, the spirit of all spirits of a better time, the strength of all the strength of heroes—you wanted one man to take  their place for you!—Do you not see now how poor, how rich, you  are?
-----
why you must be so proud and so downcast?
-----
why joy and  sorrow visit you in such dreadful alternation?
-----
"It is because you have everything and nothing, because the phantom of the golden days that must come belongs to you and yet is not here, because you are ajpitizen in the regions of Justice and Beauty,  are a god among gods in the beautiful dreams that steal upon you by  day, and when you awaken you find yourself standing on the soil of  modern Greece.
-----
"Twice, did you say?
-----
Oh, in a single day you are flung from heaven to earth seventy times.
-----
Shall I say it?
-----
I fear for you, you can ill endure  the destiny of this age.
-----
You will yet attempt many things, you will—  v uOh, God!
-----
and your last refuge will be a grave!"
-----
"No, Diotima," I cried, "by Heaven, no!
-----
So long as one melody  still sounds for me, I fear not the deathly stillness of the wilderness      under the stars; so long as the sun shines, and Diotima, there is no  night for me.
-----
"Let the death bell toll for every virtue; yet I hear you, you, the  song of your heart, O you whom I love!
-----
and find immortal life, while  all other things must die and fade away."
-----
"Hyperion," she cried, "what are you saying?"
-----
UI say what I must.
-----
I can no longer, no longer hide all my bliss and  fear and anxiety—Diotima!—Yes, you know it, must know ikjp>u  have long since seen that I perish if you do not reach out your hand  tö me."
-----
"  She was astonished, bewildered.
-----
"And is it I," she cried, "is it I in whom Hyperion would seek  support?
-----
yes, I wish—now for the first time I wish—that I were more  than a mortal maiden.
-----
But I am to you what I can be."
-----
"Oh, then you are all to me!"
-----
I cried.
-----
"All?
-----
wicked hypocrite!
-----
what, then, of humanity, your last and  only love?"
-----
"Humanity?"
-----
I said; "let humanity make Diotima its watchword  and paint your picture on its banner and say: Today shall the divine  have victory!9 Angel from heaven!
-----
what a day that would be!"
-----
"Go," she cried, "go, and show heaven your transfiguration!
-----
It  must not be so close to me.
-----
"You will go, will you not, dear Hyperion?"
-----
I obeyed.
-----
Who in my place would not have obeyed?
-----
I went.
-----
Never  before had I gone from her thus, O Bellarmin!
-----
it was joy, serenity of  life, divine peace, heavenly, wondrous, unfathomable joy!
-----
Words avail not here, and he who would seek her like has never  known her.
-----
The one thing that could express such a joy was Di«  otima's own singing when it floated between height and depth, in the  golden mean.
-----
O you meadows on the banks of Lethe!
-----
you sunset paths to the  woods erf Elysium!
-----
you lilies by the valley's streams!
-----
you garlands of  roses about the hill!
-----
I believe in you in this gracious hour and say to  my heart: There you will find her again, and all the joy that you lost.
-----
5  Hyperion to Bellarmin  I will tell you more and yet more of my happiness.
-----
I will try the temper of my heart on the joys of the past until it is  like steel; I will exercise myself upon them until I am invincible.
-----
Ha!
-----
do they not often fall upon my soul like a sword-stroke?
-----
but I  play with the sword until I am used to it, I hold my hand in the fire  until I can bear it as if it were water.
-----
I will not faint; yes; I will be strong!
-----
I will hide nothing from  myself, will conjure up the bliss of all blisses from the grave.
-----
It is incredible that a man should fear the most beautiful; yet jtis  jp.
-----
*"" Oh, have I not fled a hundred times from these moments, this  mortal ecstasy of my memories, turned away my eyes as a child does  from lightning!
-----
Yet in the luxuriant garden of the world there grows  nothing lovelierlEän.my joys, neither in heaven nor on garth does  anything nobler flourish than my joys.
-----
But only to you, my Bellarmin, only to a pure, free soul like yours,  do I tell it.
-----
I will not be as lavish as die sun with its rays; I will not  cast my pearls before the lowly multitude.
-----
After that last conversation in which our souls met, I knew myself  less every day.
-----
I felt there was a holy secret between me and Diotima.
-----
I wondered, dreamed.
-----
As if a blessed spirit had appeared to me at  midnight and chosen me to be his companion—such was the state of  my soul.
-----
Oh, it is a strange mixture of bliss and melancholy when it  becomes apparent to us that we are forever outside of ordGnary  existence.
-----
After that, I never managed to see Diotima alone.
-----
There was  always some third person to intrude on us, separate us, and the  world lay between her and me like an unbounded emptiness.
-----
Six  days of mortal dread passed in this way, during which I had no  knowledge of Diotima.
-----
It was as if the others about us paralyzed my  senses, as if they killed my entire outward life, so that there was no  way by which my imprisoned soul could reach her.
-----
If I tried to find her with my eyes, night fell around me; if I tried to  approach her with a word, it stuck in my throat.
-----
Ah!
-----
my heart was often torn to pieces by my sacred, ineffable      longing, my love often raged in me as powerfully as an imprisoned  Titan.
-----
Never before had my spirit strained so fervently, so implacably, against the chains that Roe wrought for it, against the iron, inexorable law that kept it separate, that would not let it be one soul with its adorable other halt  The star-bright night had now become my element.
-----
Then, when  all was still, as in the depths of the earth where gold grows in secret,  then the more beautiful life of my love began.
-----
Then my heart indulged its poetic right.
-----
It told me how Hyperion's spirit had played with his dear Diotima in the Elysium of the unborn before it came down to earth, in divine childhood innocence, beside the music of the fountain and under branches that were like earthy brandies when we see them reflected, beautified  from the golden water.
-----
And, like the past, the gates of the future opened within me.
-----
We flew, Diotima and I; we wandered from one springtime of the  world to another, through all the Sun's wide realm and beyond, to  the other isles erf heaven, to the golden shores of Sirius and Arcturus>  vale of spirits—  Oh, it is so to be desired to drink the joy of the world from one  cup with the beloved!
-----
Intoxicated by the blissful lullaby that I sang to myself, I fell  asleep amid those glorious phantoms.
-----
But when the life of the earth was kindled again by the rays of  morning, I looked up and sought for the dreams of the night.
-----
Like  the lovely stars, they had vanished, and only the joy of grief bore  witness to them in my soul.
-----
I mourned; but I believe that there is such mourning among the  blessed, too.
-----
It was the messenger of joy, this grief, it was the graying  dawn in which countless roses bud in die red of morning.
-----
The burning summer day had now driven all things to seek refuge  in the deepest shade.
-----
In Diotima's house, too, all was now still and  empty, and the envious curtains stood in my way at every window.
-----
I lived in thoughts of her.
-----
Where are you, I thought, where shall  my lonely spirit find you, sweet maiden?
-----
Do you stare aimlessly and  muse?
-----
Have you laid your work aside to sit with elbow on knee and  your head on your little hand, giving yourself to lovely thoughts?
-----
Let nothing disturb her peace if my quiet one is refreshing her    5  heart with sweet fancies, let nothing touch this cluster of grapes and  graze the quickening dew from its delicate berries.
-----
So I dreamed.
-----
But while my thoughts were looking for her inside  the walls of the house, my feet sought her elsewhere, and before I  knew it I was walking under the arcades of the sacred wood behind  Diotima's garden, where I had seen her for the first time.
-----
But what  was this?
-----
Since then I had so often mingled among those trees, had  become familiar with them, more at peace under them; now a power  laid hold of me, it was as if I stepped within Diana's shadow and  must die from the presence of the goddess.
-----
Meanwhile I walked on.
-----
With every step the wonder within me  grew stronger.
-----
I wanted to fly away, but it was as if my feet were  weighted with lead.
-----
My soul had hurried on before and forsaken my  earthly limbs.
-----
I heard no more, every shape grew dim and tremulous  before my eyes.
-----
My spirit was already with Diotima; the tree top  played in the light of morning while the lower branches still felt the  chill of dawn.
-----
"Ah!
-----
my Hyperion!"
-----
a voice now called to me; I flew toward it;  "My Diotima!
-----
O my Diotima!
-----
"—beyond that I had no words and  no breath, no consciousness.
-----
Vanish, vanish, mortal life, paltry commerce, in which the lone  spirit looks ever and again at the pennies it has gathered together  and counts them over; we are all called to the bliss of the gods!
-----
There is a gap in my existence here.
-----
I died, and when I awoke I  was lying against the heart of the heavenly maiden.
-----
O life of love!
-----
in what a ravishing, perfect flowering did you  appear in her!
-----
as if lightly sung to sleep by blessed geniuses, the  enchanting head lay on my shoulder, smiling sweet peace, raising  eyes the color of the ether to me in happy, innocent amazement, as if  they were even now looking at the world for the first time.
-----
Long did we stand thus, ourselves forgotten in lovely contemplation, neither of us knowing what was happening to us, until at last joy increased in me too greatly and my lost speech broke forth  in tears and cries of delight and roused my rapt, silent Diotima back  to life.
-----
At last we looked around us again.
-----
"O my old, kindly trees!"
-----
cried Diotima, as if she had not seen  them for a long time, and the memory of her earlier solitary days      played over her joys, as charmingly as shadows upon virgin snow  when it reddens and glows in the joyous light of sunset.
-----
"Angel from heaven," I cried, "who can conceive of you?
-----
who can  say that he has wholly understood you?"
-----
"Are you surprised," she answered, "that I am so fond of you?
-----
O  my proudly humble beloved!
-----
Am I, dien, one of those who cannot  believe in you?
-----
have I not fathomed you, not recognized the genius  among his clouds?
-----
Hide yourself as much as you will, refuse to see  yourself; I will conjure you forth, I will—  "But he is already here, he has come forth like a star; he has  broken through the husk and stands there like spring; like a crystal  stream from a dark cavern, so has he come forth; this is not the  somber Hyperion, this is no longer the wild mourning—O my own,  my glorious boy!"
-----
All this was like a dream to me.
-----
Could I believe in such a miracle  of love?
-----
could I?
-----
the joy of it would have killed me.
-----
"Divine creature!"
-----
I cried, "is it to me that you speak?
-----
can you  thus deny yourself, deny your blissful self-sufficiency!
-----
can you thus  rejoice in me?
-----
Oh, now I see, now I know, what I have dimly  surmised so often: man is a garment that a god often wears» a cup  into which heaven pours its nectar, that its childrerrrngy taste of the  best^"—  "Yes, yes!"
-----
she interrupted me, smiling raptly, "your namesake,  the glorious Hyperion of heaven, is in you."
-----
.
-----
"Let me," I cried, "let me be yours, let me forget myself» let all the life of body and spirit in me fly but to you; but to you, in blissful,  endless contemplation!
-----
O Diotima!
-----
so did I once stand, too, before  the shadowy divine image that my love created for itself, before the  idofof my lonely dreams; I nourished it faithfully; I animated it with  my life, with my heart's hopes I refreshed it, warmed it, but it gave  me nothing save what I had given, and when I had become impoverished, it left me poor; and now!
-----
now I have you in my arms and I feeljthe breath of your breast, and feel your eyes in my eyes, your  'Beautiful presence flows into all my senses, and I can bear it, now I  possess all that is most glorious, and tremble no longer, yes!
-----
truly I  am not he who I was, Diotima!
-----
I have become like you, and divinity  plays with divinity like children playing together.
-----
"—  "But try to be a litde calmer," she said.
-----
6  "You are right, my lovable one!"
-----
I cried joyously; "if I am not, the Graces do not appear to me; if I am not, I do not see the sweet,  subtle movements of Beauty's sea.
-----
Oh, I will yet learn to overlook  nothing of you.
-----
Only give me time!"
-----
"Flatterer!"
-----
she cried, "but this must be the end for today, dear flatterer!
-----
the golden cloud of evening has given me warning.
-----
O be not  sad!
-----
Reserve this pure joy for you and for me!
-----
Let it echo in you  until tomorrow, and kill it not with discontent!
-----
the heart's flowers  need gentle care.
-----
Their roots are everywhere, but they themselves  flourish only in fair weather.
-----
Farewell, Hyperion!"
-----
She freed herself.
-----
My whole being flamed up in me, as she  vanished from me in her glowing beauty.
-----
"O you!"
-----
I cried, and ran after her and gave my soul into her hand  in endless kisses.
-----
"God!"
-----
she cried, "what will come of this?"
-----
That struck home.
-----
"Forgive me, divine creature!"
-----
I said, "I go.
-----
Good night, Diotima!
-----
Only think of me a little!"
-----
"I will," she cried, "good night!"
-----
And now not another word, my Bellarmin.
-----
It would be too much  for my longsuffering heart.
-----
I feel I am shaken.
-----
But I will go out  among the plants and trees and lie down among them and pray that  Nature may bring me to a quiet like theirs.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Our souls now lived ever more freely and beautifully together, and  everything in us and around us fused into golden peace.
-----
It seemed as  if the old world had died and a new were beginning with us, so pure  and strong and loving and light had everything become, and we and  all that has being floated together in blissful union, like a chorus of a  thousand inseparable tones, through the endless ether.
-----
Our conversations glided on like a sky-blue stream from which  the golden sand gleams now and again, and our silence was like the  silence of the mountain peak, where, in glorious, lofty solitude, high  above the realm of storms, only the air of heaven still murmurs  through the bold traveler's hair.
-----
And the wondrous, sacred grie£ when the hour of parting tolled  through our exaltation, and I often cried: "Now we are mortal  again, Diotima!"
-----
and she said: "Mortality is illusion, is like the  colors that quiver before our eyes when they have long looked at the  sunr  Ah!
-----
and all the gracious pastimes of love!
-----
the cajoling words, the  misgivings, the sensitivities, the sternness and indulgence*  And the all-embracing knowledge with which we saw through  each other, and the infinite trust with which we glorified each other!
-----
Yes!
-----
man is a sun, all-seeing and all-illuminating, when he loves;  loving not, he is a dark house in which a smoking lamp burns.
-----
I should be silent, should forget and be silent.
-----
But the bewitching flame tempts me until I plunge into it and, like  the moth, perish.
-----
Amid all this blessed, unrestrained giving and taking, I one day  felt that Diotima was becoming more and more quiet.
-----
I questioned, I implored; but that seemed only to make her yet  more distant; finally she implored me to question her no more, to  go, and, when I returned, to talk of something else.
-----
That cast me,  too, into a painful silence, which I found hard to bear.
-----
It was as if an unbelievably sudden fate had vowed the death of our  love, and all life was gone, from me and from all else.
-----
I was ashamed of this feeling; I knew very well that chance did not  govern Diotima's heart.
-----
But what she was remained a mystery to me,  and my pampered, disconsolate spirit ever demanded manifest and  present love; for it, hidden treasures were lost treasures.
-----
Ah!
-----
in my  happiness I had come to forget hope, at that time I was still like  those impatient children who cry for the apple on the tree as if it  were not there at all unless it is kissing their lips.
-----
I knew no rest,  again I implored, violently and meekly, in tenderness and anger, love  armed me with all its invincible, humble eloquence, and now—O  my Diotima!
-----
now I had it, the enchanting confession, I have it now  and shall keep it, until the tide of love brings me, too, with all that I  am, back to our ancient home, to the bosom of Nature.
-----
The innocent being!
-----
not yet did she know the power and richness  of her heart, and sweedy terrified by the wealth within her, she  buried it in die depths of her breast—and when now, with oh!
-----
what    6  sacred ingenuousness, she confessed, confessed with tears, that she  loved too much, and took leave of all that she had until then cradled  against her heart, and cried: "I have become unfaithful to May and  summer and autumn, and heed not day and night as once I did,  belong no more to Heaven and Earth, belong but to one, to one; but  the bloom of May and the flame of summer and the ripeness of  autumn, the brightness of day and the solemnity of night, and Earth  and Heaven are united for me in that one!
-----
so do I love!"
-----
and when  now, in utter content of heart she looked at me, when, in brave, holy  joy she took me into her beautiful arms and kissed my forehead and  my mouth, ha!
-----
when that divine head, dying in bliss, sank down  against my bared throat, and the sweet lips rested on my beating  breast and her lovely breath touched my soul—O Bellarmin!
-----
my  senses fail me, and my spirit flees.
-----
I see, I see how it must end.
-----
The rudder has dropped into the tide  and the ship, like a child caught by the feet, is seized and flung  against the cliffs.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Life has great hours.
-----
We gaze up at them as at the colossal figures of  the Future and of Antiquity; we fight a glorious fight with them, and  if we hold our own against them, they become like sisters and never  forsake us.
-----
Once we were sitting together on our mountain, on a stone of the  city that anciently stood on this island; we were talking together of  how the lion Demosthenes found his end here, how by a sacred, self-  sought death, he here made his way out of Macedonian chains and  daggers to freedom.—"That glorious spirit departed from the world  with a jest," cried one.
-----
"Why not?"
-----
I said; "there was nothing left for him here; Athens had become Alexander's whore, and the world  was being hounded to death like a deer by the great huntsman."
-----
"O Athens!"
-----
cried Diotima; "I have more than once mourned  when I looked out and the phantom of the Olympieion rose before  me from the blue twilight!"
-----
"How long a crossing is it?"
-----
I asked.
-----
"A day's journey, more or less," answered Diotima.
-----
"A day's journey!"
-----
I cried, aand I have not yet been there?
-----
We must  go across together at once."
-----
"Indeed yes!"
-----
cried Diotima; "we shall have a calm sea tomorrow,  and everything is still in its time of greenness and ripeness.
-----
"The eternal sun and the life of die immortal earth are essential  for such a pilgrimage."
-----
"Tomorrow, then!"
-----
I cried, and our friends assented.
-----
We started early, the roosters were still crowing as we passed out  of the roadstead.
-----
The world shone fresh and bright, and so did we.
-----
In our hearts was the golden peace of youth.
-----
The life in us was like  the life of a newborn ocean island, with its first spring just beginning.
-----
Under Diotima's influence, my soul had long since atöineimore  equipoise; today I felt this with threefold clarity, and my dispersed  and roving powers were all concentrated in one golden mean.
-----
We talked of the excellence of the ancient Athenians, of whence it  arose and in what it consisted.
-----
One said that the climate had produced it; another: art and  philosophy; a third: religion and form of government.
-----
"Athenian art and religions, and philosophy and form of government," said I, "are flowers and fruits of the tree, not soil and root.
-----
You take the effects for the cause.
-----
"But let him who tells me that the climate produced all this  consider that we still live in it ourselves.
-----
"Left more undisturbed in every way, freer from ruthless interference than any other people on earth^sq did then Athenian people grow to mänEood.
-----
No conqueror weakens them, no success in war  intoxicates them, no foreign religion stupefies them, no rash  wisdom urges them to premature ripeness.
-----
Left to itself, like the  forming diamond—such is their childhood.
-----
Almost nothing is heard  of them until the rimes of Pisistratus and Hipparchus.
-----
They took but  a small part in the Trojan War, which, as in a hothouse, too early  heated and stimulated most of the Greek peoples.—An extraordinary destiny never begets men.
-----
The sons of such a mother are great, are giants, but they never become beings of beauty or, what is the  same thing, men—or else not until late, when the opposing forces in  them battle too savagely not to make peace at last.
-----
"In exuberant vigor Lacedaemon rushes ahead of the Athenians,    6  and for that very reason would have dissipated and dissolved itself,  had not Lycurgus come and, for all its overweening nature, held it  together by his discipline.
-----
From then on everything in the Spartan  was an achievement, every excellence was laboriously conquered,  bought at the price of conscious effort, and if in a certain sense we  can speak of Spartan simplicity, still the true simplicity of the child  was completely lacking in them.
-----
The Lacedaemonians too early  transgressed the order of instinct, they degenerated too soon, hence  discipline, too, had likewise to begin for them too early; for every  discipline and art begins top early when man's nature has not yet  become mature.
-----
Nature must have developed~tö~perfection iirthe  human child before he goes to school, so that the image of childhood may show him the way back from school to the perfection of Nature.
-----
"The Spartans forever remained a fragment; for he who was not  once a perfect child is hard put to it to become a perfect man.—  "It is true, too, that Heaven and Earth did their part for the  Athenians, as for all the Greeks, gave them neither poverty nor  superfluity.
-----
The rays of Heaven did not fall on them like a rain of fire.
-----
Earth did not pamper them, intoxicate them, with caresses and  excessive gifts, as the foolish Mother sometimes does elsewhere.
-----
"To add to this, came Theseus9 prodigious act, his voluntary  limitation of his own royal power.
-----
"Oh!
-----
such a seed sown in the hearts of the people cannot but  bring forth an ocean of golden ears, and even at this late hour it still  visibly operates and flourishes among *he Athenians.
-----
"*I say it again!
-----
That the Athenians grew up so free from every kind  of ruthless interference, on so moderate a diet—it was this that made  them so outstandingly excellent, and only this could do it!
-----
"Leave the human being undisturbed from the cradle on!
-----
do not  force him out of the close-wrapped bud of his being, the small house  of his childhood!
-----
Do not do too little, lest he make shift without  you, and hence distinguish you from himself; do not do too much,  lest he feel your power or his own, and hence distinguish you from  himself; in short, let him not learn until late that there are men, that  there is something else outside of himself, for only thus will he  become a man.
-----
But man is a god as soon as he is man.
-----
And once he  is a god, he is beaut3uE*~~      "How strange!"
-----
cried one of our friends.
-----
"%u have never yet spoken so deeply from my soul," cried  Diotima.
-----
"It comes to me from you," I answered.
-----
"It is so that the Athenian was a man," I continued; "and so he  could not but become a man.
-----
Beautiful he came from Nature's  hands, beautiful in body and soul, as the saying goes.
-----
"The first child of human, of divine Beauty is art.
-----
In art the divine  man rejuvenates, and' repeats himself, He wants to feel himself,  therefore he sets his Beauty over against himself, Thus did man give  himself his gods.
-----
For in the beginning man and his gods 3#ere-0ne,  when, unknown to itself, eternal Beauty was.
-----
I speak mysteries, but they exist.—  "The first child of divine Beauty is art.
-----
Thus it was among the  Athenians.
-----
"Beauty's second daughter is religion.
-----
Religion is love of Beauty.
-----
The wise man loves Beauty herself, eternal, all-embräcing Beauty;  the people love her children, the gods, who appear to them in  multifarious forms.
-----
So it was, too, among the Athenians.
-----
And  without such a love of Beauty, without such a religion, every sj&£_kii  dry skeleton without life and spirit, all thought and action is a tree  without a top, a columnwhose crown has been cut oft  "That this was indeed the case among the Greeks, and especially  the Athenians, that their art and their religion were the true children  of eternal Beauty—perfect human nature—and could only spring  from perfect human nature, is clearly apparent if we will but look  with unprejudiced eyes at the productions of their sacred art and at  the religion with which they loved and honored them.
-----
"Shortcomings and false steps are to be found everywhere, and  hence here too.
-----
But it is certain that, even so, in most of the  productions of their art we find man in his maturity.
-----
Here there is  neither the pettiness nor the colossality erf the Egyptians and the  Goths, here there is human intelligence and human proportions.
-----
They run less than otRerpeoples to the extremes of the metaphysical  ^andthe physical.
-----
Their gods remain more nearly in the golden mean  of humanity than others.
-----
"And even as the productions erf their art were, so was their love.
-----
Not too servile, and not too familiar!—    6  "This beauty of mind and spirit in the Athenians inevitably produced die indispensable sense of freedom.
-----
"'The Egyptian impassively bears the despotism of arbitrary  power, the son of the North unprotestingly bears the despotism erf  law, injustice in the form erf codes of justice; for the Egyptian is born  from die womb with an urge to do homage, to idolatrize; in the  North, men believe too litde in the pure, free ilife of Nature not to  cling superstitiously to legality.
-----
f  "The Athenian cannot tolerate arbitrary power, because his divine  nature refuses to be intruded upon, he cannot tolerate legality  everywhere because he does not need it everywhere.
-----
Draco is not for  him.
-----
He insists on being treated gently, and he is right to do so."
-----
"Well and good!"
-----
someone interrupted me; "I understand this,  but I do not see how this poetic and religious people also comes to  be a philosophical people."
-----
"The fact is," I answered, "that without poetry they would never  have been a philosophical people!"
-----
"What has philosophy," he answered, "what has the cold sublimity of philosophical knowledge, to do with poetry?"
-----
"Poetry," I answered, confident of my argument, "is the beginning and the end of philosophical knowledge.
-----
Like Minerva from the  head of Jupiter, philosophy springs from the poetry of an eternal,  divine state of being.
-----
And so in philosophy, too, the irreconcilable  finally converges again in the mysterious spring of poetry."
-----
"What a paradoxical man!"
-----
cried Diotima; "yet I understand  him.
-----
But you two digress.
-----
We are talking of Athens."
-----
"The man," I resumed, "who has not at least once in his life felt full, pure beauty in himself, when the powers of his being merged  like the colors in the rainbow, who has never felt the profound  harmony that arises among all things only in hours of exaltation—  that man will not even be a philosophical sceptic, his mind is not  even capable of tearing down, let alone of building up.
-----
Far, believe  me, die sceptic finds contradiction and imperfection in all thatjs  jhoiy^t^becaus^ harmony of perfect beauty, which is  never thought.
-----
The dry bread that human reason well-meaningly  offers him, he disdains only because he is secredy feasting at die  table of the gods."
-----
"Visionary!"
-----
cried Diotima.
-----
"So that is why you, too, were a  sceptic But the Athenians!"
-----
"1 am close upon them," I said.
-----
"The great saying, the €v  Stct<p€pov count) (the one differentiated in itself) of Heraclitus, could  be found only by a Greek, for it is the very being of Beauty, and  before that was found there was no philosophy  "Now classification became possible, for the whole was there.
-----
The  flower had ripened; now it could be dissected.
-----
"The moment of beauty was now well known to men, it was there  in life and thought, the infinitely one existed.
-----
"It could be analyzed, taken apart in men's minds, it could be  reconstituted from its components, and so the being of the highest  and the best could be increasingly known, and the knowledge of it  be set up as the law in all the multifarious realms of the spirit.
-----
"Do you see now why the Athenians in particular could not but  be a philosophical people too?
-----
"Not so the Egyptian.
-----
He who does not live loving Heaven and  Earth and loved by them in equal measure, he who does not live at  one in this sense with the element in which he has his being, is by his  very nature not so at one with himself as a Greek, at least he does not  experience eternal Beauty as easily as a Greek does.
-----
"Like a grandiose despot, the East in its power and splendor casts  its inhabitants to the ground and, before man has learned to walk,  he is forced to kneel, before he has learned to speak, he is forced to  pray; before his heart has attained an equipoise it is forced to bow,  before his spirit is strong enough to bear flowers and fruit, Fate and  Nature drains all his strength through torrid heat.
-----
The Egyptian is  devoted before he is a whole, hence he knows nothing of the whole,  nothing of Beauty, and what he calls the highest is a veiled power, an  awesome enigma; the dumb, dark Isis is his first and last, an empty  infinity, and out of that nothing reasonable has ever come.
-----
Even the  most sublime nothingness gives birth to nothingness.
-----
"The North, on the contrary, too early turns its nurslings in upon '  themselves, and if the spirit of the fiery Egyptian hurries forth too  eagerly to journey through the world, in the North the spirit begins  to return into itself even before it is ready to travel.
-----
"In the North one must be judicious before one's capacity for    6  feeling has fully developed, one thinks oneself guilty of everything  even before ingenuousness has achieved its beautiful end: one must  be reasonable, must become a conscious intelligence befoa^neusji^  Tnan, Be a shrewd majiJfeefore one is a child; the oneness of the  whole m ^ , Beauty is not allowed to thrive and ripen in him before  he cultivates and develops himselt Pure intellect, pure reason "aFeT  always the kings of the North.
-----
^But pure intellect has never produced anything intelligent, nor^  pure reason anything reasonable.
-----
( "*"  , "Without beauty of spirit, intellect is like a willing journeyman  who constructs the fence out of rough timber as it has been sketched  out for him and nails the sawn and planed posts together for the  garden that his master intends to plant.
-----
The entire business of  intellect is makeshift.
-----
By its ability to sort out, it saves us from folly,  from injustice; but to be safe from folly and injustice is, after all, not  the highest level of human excellence.
-----
> "Reason without beauty of spirit and heart is like an overseer  whom the master of the house has set over the servants; he knows as  little as they do what will come of all their endless toil, he only  shouts: "Get busy,9 and is almost sorry to find the work being  accomplished, for in the end he would have nothing more to oversee,  and his part would be played.

^ ^Mere reason produces no philosophy, for philosophy is more  than the blind demand for ever greater progress in the combination  and differentiation of some particular material.

"But once the light of the divine ev Stoupepov eavnp, which is  struggling reason's ideal of Beauty, shines out, it does not demand  blindly, it knows why and to what end it demands.
-----
"If the sun of the Beautiful shines for intellect at its work, as a  May day shines into the artist's workshop» it does not go running out  and leave its work of makeshift unfinished, though it thinks fondly  of the holiday when it will rove abroad in the rejuvenating light of  spring."
-----
Thus far had I discoursed, when we landed on the shores of  Attica.
-----
Ancient Athens was now too much in our minds for us to engage      in anything like an orderly conversation, and I now felt surprised  myself at die sort of things I had been saying.
-----
"How did I ever  come," I cried, "to be on the arid mountain peak on which you saw  me just now?"
-----
"It is ever thus," Diotima answered, "when we feel at our best.
-----
Exuberant strength seeks something to do.
-----
Young lambs butt their  heads together when they are sated with their mother's milk."
-----
We made our way to the summit of Lycabettus, and, though  pressed for time, we stopped now and again wrapped in thought,  preparing ourselves for wonders to come.
-----
It is beautiful that man finds it so hard to convince himself of the  death of what he loves, probably no one has ever visited a friend's  grave without some faint hope of really finding his friend there.
-----
The  beautiful phantom of ancient Athens took possession of me like the  figure of a mother returning from the realm of the dead.
-----
"O Parthenon!"
-----
I cried, "pride of the world!
-----
Neptune's kingdom  lies at thy feet like a subjugated lion, and around you the other  temples cluster like children, and the eloquent Agora and the Grove  of Academe—"  "Can you thus transport yourself to ancient times?"
-----
asked Diotima.
-----
"Remind me not of time!"
-----
I answered; "it was a divine life and in it man was the center of Nature.
-----
Spring, when it blossomed about  Athens, was like a modest flower on a maiden's bosom; the sun rose  red with shame before the glories of earth.
-----
"The marble cliffs of Hymettus and Bentelicus leaped from their  slumbering cradle like children from their mother's lap, and attained  form and life under the loving hands of Athenians.
-----
"Nature bestowed honey and the most beautiful violets and myrtles and olives.
-----
"Nature was a priestess and man her god, and all life in her and  her every form and sound were but a single rapt echo of that glorious  one to whom she belonged.
-----
"Him did she celebrate, to him only did she sacrifice.
-----
"And he was worthy of it, whether he sat fondly in the sacred  workshop clasping the knees of the divine image that he had fashioned, or lay at ease among his listening students on Sunium's green promontory, whiling away the time with high thoughts, or ran in the    7  Stadium, or, from the orator's tribune, sent rain and sunshine and  thunder and golden clouds, like the Storm God—"  "Oh, look!"
-----
Diotima suddenly cried to me.
-----
I looked, and could have fainted, so mighty was the spectacle.
-----
Like an immense shipwreck, when the gales have been hushed  and the sailors have fled and the corpse of the shattered fleet lies on  the sandbank unrecognizable, so before us lay Athens, and the  jorsaken pillars stood before us like bare treetrunks of a wood that  at evening was still green and, the same night, went up in flames.
-----
"Here," said Diotima, "one learns to accept one's own fate in  silence, be it good or bad."
-----
"Here," I continued, "one learns to accept all things in silence.
-----
HaS the reapers who mowed this grainfield enriched their barns  with its stalks, nothing would have been lost, and IshoülcTTie  content to stand here as a gleaner—but who was the winner?"
-----
"The whole of Europe," answered one of our friends.
-----
"Oh, yes!"
-----
I cried, "they have dragged away the columns and  statues and sold them to one another, they have put no small price  on those noble forms—for their rarity, as one prizes parrots and  monkeys."
-----
"Say not so," the same man answered; "if it is indeed true that the spirit of all beauty is not among them, it is because it could not be  carried away, could not be bought."
-----
"Yes!"
-----
I cried, "yes!
-----
That spirit had perished even before the  destroyers descended on Attica.
-----
Not until houses and temples have  been deserted do the wild beasts dare to venture into gateways and  streets."
-----
"For him who possesses that spirit," said Diotima consolingly,  ^Athens still stands like a blossomingTruit tree.
-----
The artist can easily  restore the torso for hiniselfc"  The next morning we set out early, saw the ruins of the Parthenon,  the site of the ancient Theater of Dionysus, the Temple of Theseus,  the sixteen still-standing pillars of the divine Olympieion; but what  struck me most was the ancient gate that in times past afforded  passage from the old city to the new, where once a thousand  beautiful men and women must have greeted each other in a single  day.
-----
Now the gate gives passage to neither the old nor the new city, it  stands there silent and empty, like a dried up fountain from whose  conduits clear, cool water once poured with a welcoming splash.
-----
"Ah!"
-----
said I as we walked about, "Fate makes brave sport here,  throwing down temples and giving their shattered stones to children  to play with, turning disfigured gods into benches before peasants'  huts, and tombs into resting places for pasturing cattle; such prodigality is more royal than Cleopatra's whim of drinking dissolved pearl—but alas for all that beauty and greatness!"
-----
"Dear Hyperion P cried Diotima, "it is time for you to go from  here; you are pale, your eyes are tired, and you seek in vain to  sustain yourself with new thoughts.
-----
Come out where it is green!
-----
out  among the colors of life!
-----
That will do you good."
-----
j  We went out into the nearby gardens.
-----
The others, having fallen into talk with two English scholars who  were reaping a harvest from the antiquities of Athens, were not to be  budged.
-----
I was glad to leave them.
-----
My whole being revived when I found myself alone with Diotima  again; she had fought a magnificent fight against the sacred chaos of  Athens.
-----
As the lyre of Urania above the discordant elements, so  Diotima's quiet thoughts ruled above the ruins.
-----
As the moon out of a  tenuous cloudbank, so her spirit rose out of her beautiful sorrow;  the divine maiden stood there in her grief like the flower that  breathes forth its loveliest perfume in die dark of night.
-----
We walked on and on, and at last had not walked in vain.
-----
O you groves of Angele, where the olive tree and the cypress,  whispering together, cool each other with pleasant shade, where the  golden fruit of the lemon tree glimmers from among dark leaves,  where the swelling grape grows luxuriantly on the stake, and the  ripe bitter-orange lies by the wayside like a smiling foundling!
-----
you  sweet-scented, hidden paths, you peaceful seats, where the reflection  of the myrtle smiles out of die spring!
-----
never shall I forget you.
-----
Diotima and I walked about for a while under the glorious trees,  until we came upon a bright open expanse.
-----
Here we sat down.
-----
There was a blissful silence between us.JMy  spirit fluttered about the maiden's divine form like a butterfly about  a flower, and my wholeBeing was ea&ed and brought to harmony in  the joy of inspiring contemplation.
-----
aAre you so soon comforted, confused one?"
-----
said Diotima.
-----
"Yes, yes, I am!"
-----
I answered.
-----
"What I thought was lost, I have;  what I pined for as if it had vanished from the world, is here before  me.
-----
No, Diotima!
-----
the spring of eternal Beauty has not yet dried up.
-----
7  "I have said it to you before: I need gods and men no longer.
-----
I  know that Heaven is desolate, depopulated, and that Earth, which  once overflowed with beautiful human life, is become almost like an  anthill.
-----
But there is still a place where the old Heaven and the old  earth smile for me.
-----
For the gods of Heaven and the godlike men of  the Earth—I forget them all in you.
-----
"What care I for the shipwreck of the world; I know nothing but  my blessed island."
-----
"There is a time for love," said Diotima with gentle seriousness,  "as there is a time to live in the happy cradle.
-----
But life itself drives us  forth.
-----
"Hyperion!
-----
"—here she ardently grasped my hand, and her voice  rose grandly—"Hyperion!
-----
I think you are born for higher things.
-----
Do not misjudge yourself!
-----
it was lack of material that held you bade.
-----
Things went too slowly.
-----
That cast you down.
-----
Like young fencers, you  attacked too soon, before your aim was certain and your hand  skilled; and because, as was bound to happen, you took more  thrusts than you gave, you became timid and doubted yourself and  everything else; for you are as sensitive as you are impetuous.
-----
But  that has lost you nothing.
-----
Had your heart and your capacity for  action matured so early, your spirit would not be what it is; you  would not be the thinking man, would not be the suffering, turbulent man.
-----
Believe me, you would neverhave known the equipoise of beautiful humanity so purely if you had not lost it so completely*  Your hearfhäs at last foun<Tpeace.
-----
I believe it.
-----
I understand it.
-----
But  do you truly think that you have reached the end?
-----
Do you mean to  shut yourself up in the heaven of your love, and let the world, which  needs you, wither and grow cold before you?
-----
You must shoot down  like the beam of light, you must descend like the all-refreshing rain,  into the land of mortar men, you must illuminate like Apollo, shake  and animate like Jupiter, or you are not worthy of your heaven.
-----
1 beg  you: go back into Athens once again, and look not only at the ruins but also at the men who walk among them, the wild Albanians and  the other good-hearted, childlike Greeks, who console themselves  with a merry dance and a pious tale for the infamous oppression  that weighs upon them—can you say, 'I am ashamed to work with  this material?'
-----
I think it can still be fashioned.
-----
Can you turn your  heart from those who are in need?
-----
They are not evil, they have done  you no harm!"
-----
"What can I do for them?"
-----
I cried.
-----
"Give them what you have within you," answered Diotima,  "give—"  "Not another word, noble soul!"
-----
I cried, "else you will bend me,  else it will be as if you had brought me to it by force—  "They will not be happier, but nobler—no!
-----
they will be happier  too.
-----
They must arise, they must come forth, like young mountains  out of the ocean when their underground fire drives them.
-----
"It is true that I stand alone, and appear among them without a  name.
-----
But cannot one alone, if he is a man, do more than hundreds who are but fragments of men?
-----
"Sacred Nature, thouart the same within me and without.
-----
It  cannot be so hard to unite what is outside of me and the divine  within me.
-----
If the bee can make her little kingdom flourish, why  should not I be able to plant and cultivate what is needful?
-----
"What!
-----
the Arabian merchant sowed his Koran abroad, and a  people of scholars grew up for him like an endless forest, and shall  the field not thrive to which ancient truth returns in new, living  youth?
-----
"All shall be changed!
-----
From the root of humanity the new world  shall spring!
-----
A new divinity shall rule over them, a new future  brighten before them.
-----
"In the workshop» in houses, in gatherings, in temples—there will  be a change everywhere!
-----
"But I must still go away and learn.
-----
I am an artist, and I am  unskilled.
-----
I fashion in thought, but I do not yet know how to direct  my hand—"  "You shall go to Italy," said Diotima, "to Germany, Krance—how  many years do you need?
-----
three?
-----
four?—I think three are enough;  you are not the phlegmatic sort, and you seek only what is noblest  and most beautiful—"  "And then?"
-----
"You will be the teacher of our people, you will be a great man, I  hope.
-----
And when then, as now, I embrace you, I shall dream, as if I  were a part of a glorious man, I shall rejoice, as if you had given me  half of your immortality, even as Castor did to Pollux, oh!
-----
I shall be a  proud girl, Hyperion!"
-----
I remained silent for a while.
-----
I was filled with inexpressible joy.
-----
"Is it possible that there is content between the decision and the    7  act, is there rest before the victory?"
-----
"It is the rest of the hero," said Diotima, "there are decisions that, like the words of gods, are at once command and fulfillment, and  such is yours."
-----
We returned, as after our first embrace.
-----
Everything had become  strange and new for us.
-----
Now I stood above the ruins of Athens like the farmer on the  fallow field.
-----
"Only lie still," I thought, as we returned to our ship,  "only lie still, sleeping land!
-----
Soon will the young life sprout green  from thee and grow toward the blessings of Heaven!
-----
Soon will the  clouds never rain in vain, soon will the Sun find his old nurslings  once more.
-----
"You ask for men, Nature?
-----
You complain, like a lyre on which  only that brother of chance, the wind, plays because die artist who  imposed order on it has died?
-----
They will come, your men, O Nature!
-----
A rejuvenated people will rejuvenate you, too, and you will be as its  bride, and the old union of spirits will renew itself in you.
-----
"There will be but one Beauty; and man and Nature will be  united in one all-embracing divinity."

Sophocles  (Not to be born is, past all prizing, best; but, when a man has  seen the light, this is next best by far, that with all speed he  should go thither, whence he hath come.)
-----
Book One  Hyperion to Bellarmin  We were experiencing the last beautiful moments of the year,  after our return from Attica.
-----
7  Autumn was a brother of spring for us, full of mild fire, a festival  time for memories of sorrows and past joys of love.
-----
The fading leaves  bore the rosy hue of sunset; only die spruce and the laurel stood in  eternal green.
-----
Migrating birds lingered in the clear air, others  swarmed in vineyard and garden, joyously reaping what men had  left.
-----
And the heavenly light ran pure from the cloudless sky, the  sacred sun smiled through every twig—the kindly one, never named  by me but with joy and gratitude, the sun that with a look has often  healed me in deep sorrow, and cleansed my soul of discontent and  cares.
-----
We visited all our best loved paths once more, Diotima and I;  vanished blissful hours met us everywhere.
-----
We remembered the past May; never, we said, had we seen the  Earth as it was then; it had been transformed, a silver cloud of  flowers, a joyous flame of life, purified of all crude matter.
-----
"Oh!
-----
all was so full of pleasure and hope," cried Diotima, "so full of unceasing growth and yet so effortless, so blessedly quiet, like a  child playing on and on without another thought."
-----
"In that," I cried, "I recognize the soul of Nature—in that still fire, in that lingering in its mighty haste."
-----
"And how dear it is to the happy, that lingering," cried Diotima;  "do you remember?
-----
once at twilight we stood together on the  bridge, after a hard storm, and the red mountain stream shot away  under us like an arrow, but there beside it the forest stood in green  peace and the bright leaves scarcely stirred.
-----
We felt so glad then that  the living green did not flee from us too, like the brook, and that the  beautiful spring stayed for us like a tame bird; yet now spring, too, is  over the hills and away."
-----
We smiled at that, although sorrow was closer to us.
-----
So was our own bliss to depart, and we foresaw it.
-----
O Bellarmin!
-----
who shall dare to say that he stands fast, when even  the beautiful thus ripens to its doom, when even the divine must  humble itself and share mortality with all that is mortal!
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  I had lingered before her house with the lovely maid, until the lamp  of night shone into the peaceful twilight; then I returned to Notara's      dwelling, full of thoughts, full of seething, heroic life, as always  when I left her embraces.
-----
A letter had come from Alabanda.
-----
"Things are stirring, Hyperion," he wifote to me, "Russia has  declared war on the Porte; they are bringing a fleet into the Archipelago;4, the Greeks are to be free if they rise and help drive the Sultan to the Euphrates.
-----
The Greeks will do their share, the Greeks  will be free, and I am heartily glad that at last there is something to  do again.
-----
I took no pleasure in the light of day, so long as this  remained undone.
-----
"If you are still what you were, come!
-----
You will find me in the  village before Coron as you come by the road from Mistra.
-----
I live  beside the hill, in the white house at the edge of the woods.
-----
"I have broken with the men whom you met through me in  Smyrna.
-----
You were right, with your finer sensitivity, not to enter their  sphere.
-----
"I long for us to see each other again in the new life.
-----
Until now,  you have seen the world as too evil for you to let it know you.
-----
Because you refused to perform servile tasks, you did nothing, and  doing nothing made you morose and dreamy.
-----
"You refused to swim in the swamp.
-----
Come now, come and let us  bathe in the open sea!
-----
"It will do us good, O you who alone I love!"
-----
So he wrote.
-----
For a moment I was aghast.
-----
My face burned with  shame, my heart seethed like hot springs, and I could not stand still,  such anguish did I feel at being outdistanced by Alabanda, outdone  forever.
-----
But then I all the more eagerly embraced the work before us.
-----
"I have grown too idle," I cried, "too fond erf my ease, too remote, too inactive!—Alabanda looks into the world like a noble pilot;  Alabanda is diligent and searches the waves for booty, and your  hands sleep on your lap?
-----
would you make do with words, and  exorcise the world with magic spells?
-----
But your words are like  snowflakes, useless, they only make the air darker, and your magic  formulas are for believers, but the unbelievers do not hear you.—  Yes!
-----
to be mild at the right time is a fine thing, but to be mild at the  wrong time is ugly, for it is cowardly!—But, Harmodius!
-----
I will  match your myrtle, your myrtle, in which the sword lay hidden.
-----
I  will not have been idle for nothing, and my sleep shall be like oil  *In the year 1770 (Hölderlin^ note).
-----
7  when flame touches it.
-----
I will not look on when the time is at hand,  and will not go about asking for news while Alabanda earns the  laurel."
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Diotima's increasing pallor as she read Alabanda's letter pierced my  soul.
-----
She then began, calmly and earnestly, to advise me against the  step, and we said many things for and against it.
-----
"O men of violence!"
-----
she cried at last, "who so quickly go to extremes, think of Nemesis!"
-----
"He who suffers extremes," I said, "is right to go to extremes."
-----
"Even if it is right," she said, "you were not born for it."
-----
"So it seems," I said; "but I have dallied long enough.
-----
Oh, would that I could load an Adas upon me, to make good the sins of my  youth.
-----
Is there consciousness in me?
-----
is there endurance?
-----
Oh, let me,  Diotima!
-----
Here, in just such work, must I gain it."
-----
"This is vain pride!"
-----
cried Diotima; "not long ago you were more  modest, not long ago when you said, 'I must still go away and  learn/ "  "Dear sophist!"
-----
I cried; "then we were talking of something  entirely different.
-----
To lead my people to the Olympus of divine  Beauty, where Truth and all Goodness gushes from springs forever  young—I am not yet fit to do that.
-----
But I have learned to use a sword,  and for the moment that is all that is needed.
-----
The new union of  spirits cannot live in the air, the sacred theocracy of the Beautiful  must dwell in a free state, and that state must have a place on earth,  and that place we shall surely conquer."
-----
"You will conquer," cried Diotima, "and forget what for; you  will, at the most, force the establishment of a free state, and then ask  yourself, "What have I been building for?9 Ah!
-----
it will be consumed,  all the beautiful life that was to have being there, it will be exhausted  even in you!
-----
The savage fight will tear you to pieces, beautiful soul,  you will grow old, blissful spirit!
-----
and, weary unto death, you will ask  in the end: 'Where are you now, you ideals of youth?'"
-----
"It is cruel, Diotima," I cried, "thus to reach into my very heart, thus to hold me fast by my own fear of death, by my highest joy in  life, but no!
-----
no!
-----
no!
-----
Servitude kills, but just war brings every soul to      life.
-----
It is casting the gold into the fire that gives it the color of the  sun!
-----
It is breaking fetters that first gives a man all his youth!
-----
It isy  arising and trampling on the adder, on the crawling century thaf  poisons all Beauty and Nature in the bud—that alone saves a/  man!—I shall grow old, shall I, Diotima, setting Greece free?
-----
grow  old and miserable, become a common man?
-----
Oh, then was he, too,  shallow and empty and forsaken of the gods, that Athenian youth,  when, bearing news of victory from Marathon, he came over the  peak of Pentelicus and looked down into the valleys of Attica!"
-----
"My love!
-----
my love!"
-----
cried Diotima, "oh, be still!
-----
I will not say  another word.
-----
You shall go, shall go, proud man!
-----
Ah!
-----
when you are  thus, I have no power over you, no right to you."
-----
x  She wept bitterly, and I stood before her like a criminal.
-----
"Forgive  me, divine maid!"
-----
I cried, kneeling at her feet, "oh, forgive me, when I am compelled!
-----
I do not choose; I do not reflect.
-----
There is a power in  me, and I know not if it is myself that drives me to this step."
-----
"Your whole soul commands you to it," she answered.
-----
"Not to obey one's  soul often leads to destruction, yet obeying it does too.
-----
It is best that  you go, for it is nobler.
-----
Act; I will bear it."
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  From then on Diotima was strangely changed.
-----
I had seen with joy how, from the time we fell in love, her silent life  had opened into looks and fond words and her inborn quietude had  often met me with shining enthusiasm.
-----
But how strange the beautiful soul becomes to us, when, after its  first blossoming, after the morning of its course, it must rise to its  high noon!
-----
The blessed child had grown almost unrecognizable, so  sublime and so sorrowful had she become.
-----
Oh, how often did I lie before that divine, mourning figure, and  thought that I should weep my soul away in grief for her, and then  myself rose up in admiration and filled with unconquerable powers!
-----
A flame had ascended into her eyes from her full heart.
-----
Her bosom,  teeming with longings and sorrows, had become too confining for  her; that is why her thoughts were so glorious and bold.
-----
A new  greatness, a visible power over everything that could feel, ruled in    8  her.
-----
She was a higher being.
-----
She belonged to the race of mortals no  longer.
-----
O my Diotima, if I had thought then to what this must come!
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  The prudent Notara, too, was enchanted by the new projects, promised me a strong following, hoped soon to occupy the Isthmus of Corinth and there take Greece as it were by the handle.
-----
But Kate  decreed otherwise, and made his work useless before it achieved its  end.
-----
He advised me not to go to Una, but to travel directly down the  Peloponnesus, escaping notice as far as possible.
-----
I was to write to my  father on the way, since the cautious old man would more easily  condone a step that had been taken than give permission for one  that had not.
-----
This was not quite to my taste, but we are prone to  sacrifice our private feelings when a great goal is before our eyes.
-----
"I doubt," Notara continued, "if you will be able to count on  your father's help in a matter of this sort.
-----
So I shall give you what you  will need in order to live and work for a time, come what may.
-----
If you  are ever able to, you can repay me; if not, what was mine was yours  as well.
-----
Feel no embarrassment about the money," he added with a  smile; "even Phoebus' horses do not live on air alone, so the poets  tell us."
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  And now the day of parting came.
-----
I had spent the whole morning up in Notara's garden, in the fresh  winter air, among the ever green cypresses and cedars.
-----
The great  powers of youth supported me, and my premonition of suffering to  come bore me higher, like a cloud.
-----
Diotima's mother had invited Notara and our other friends and  myself to pass that last day together at her house.
-----
Their kind hearts  had all rejoiced over me and Diotima, and the element of the divine  in our love had not been lost on them.
-----
And now they were to bless  my parting too.
-----
I went down, I found the dear girl at the hearth.
-----
She took it as a  sacred, priestly duty to attend to the housekeeping that day.
-----
She had  put everything to rights, had beautified everything in the house, and  no one was allowed to help her with it.
-----
She had gathered all the  flowers that still remained in the garden, she had brought roses and  fresh bunches of grapes, even at that late time of year.
-----
She recognized my footstep as I approached, she came softly  toward me; her pale cheeks glowed from the fire of the hearth, and  her eyes, larger in her new seriousness, were bright with tears.
-----
She  saw how overcome I was.
-----
"Go inside, my dear," she said; "Mother is there, and I will follow at once."
-----
I went in.
-----
There she sat, the noble woman, and held out her  beautiful hand to me.
-----
"Have you come, have you come, my son?"
-----
she cried.
-----
"I ought to be angry with you, you have taken my child  from me, have talked me out of all common sense, do just what you  please and then go away; but forgive him, you Heavenly Powers, if  what he means to do is wrong!
-----
and if it is right, then be not slow to  help the dear lad!"
-----
I was going to speak, but just then Notara and  our other friends came in, with Diotima behind them.
-----
We were silent for a while.
-----
We honored the grieving love that was  in us all; we feared to presume upon it with words and arrogant  thoughts, finally, after a few desultory remarks, Diotima asked me  to tell them something about Agis and Cleomenes; I had often  named those great souls with ardent respect and had said that they  were no less demigods than Prometheus, and their battle against  Sparta's fate more heroic than any in the most illustrious myths.
-----
The  genius of those men, I had said, was the sunset of the Greek day, as  Theseus and Homer had been its dawn.
-----
I told their story, and at its end we all felt stronger and more  exalted.
-----
"Happy is he," cried one of our friends, "whose life alternates  between joy of heart and brisk battle!"
-----
"Yes!"
-----
cried another, "that is eternal youth, when enough powers  are always in exercise and our whole selves are occupied in pleasure  and work."
-----
"Oh, that I could go with you!"
-----
Diotima cried to me.
-----
"Yet it is fitting that you remain here, Diotima!"
-----
said I.
-----
"The  priestess may not leave the temple.
-----
You guard the sacred flame, in  silence you guard the Beautiful, that I may find it again in you."
-----
8  "You are right of course, it is better," she said, and her voice  trembled, and the ether-blue eyes hid themselves in her handkerchief, that their tears, their despair might not be seen.
-----
0 Bellarmin, my heart was near to breaking because I had made  her blush so red.
-----
"Friends!"
-----
I cried, "preserve this angel for me.
-----
I know nothing more, if I know her not.
-----
O Heavens!
-----
I dare not think  for what I would be fit if I lost her."
-----
"Rest easy, Hyperion!"
-----
Notara interrupted me.
-----
"Easy?"
-----
I cried; "O you good people!
-----
you can often give thought  to how your garden will bloom and how good your harvest will be,  you can pray for your grapevine—and shall I part without concern  from what alone my soul serves?"
-----
"No, my good friend!"
-----
cried Notara, deeply moved, "no!
-----
I do not  ask that you part from her without concern!
-----
no, by the divine  innocence of your love!
-----
you have my blessing, be sure of that!"
-----
"You remind me," I cried quickly.
-----
"She shall bless us, this dear  mother, she shall bear witness for us with you all—come, Diotima!
-----
your mother shall bless our union, until the beautiful society for  which we hope joins us in marriage."
-----
1 went down on one knee; and she, wide-eyed, blushing, smiling,  and festive, sank down at my side too.
-----
"For a long time," I cried, "O Nature!
-----
has our life been at one  with you, and the world that is ours is divinely young, like you and  all your gods, through the power of love."
-----
"In your groves we wandered," Diotima continued, "and were like  you, by your springs we sat and were like you, there over the  mountains we went, with your children the stars, like you.
-----
"When we were far from each other," I cried, "when, like a  whispering harp» our coming delight first sounded for us, when we  found each other, when there was no more sleep for us, and all the  tones in us awoke to the full harmony of life, divine Nature!
-----
then  were we ever like you, and so now, too, when we part and joy dies,  we are like you, full of sorrow, yet good; therefore a pure mouth  shall bear witness for us that our love is holy and eternal, as are  you."
-----
"I bear witness to it," her mother said.
-----
"We bear witness to it," cried the others.
-----
Now there was no word left for us to speak.
-----
I felt my heart beat its      highest; I felt ripe for departure.
-----
"Now I will go, my loved ones," I  said, and life vanished from every face.
-----
Diotima stood like a marble  statue and I felt her hand die in mine.
-----
I had killed everything around  me; I was alone, and I reeled before the boundless silence in which  my seething life had no holdfast.
-----
"Ah!"
-----
I cried, amy heart is fiery hot, and you all stand so coldly,  my loved ones!
-----
and do only the Gods of the household lend ear?—  Diotima!
-----
you are silent, you do not see!—oh, well for you that you  do not see!"
-----
"Go now," she sighed, "It must be; go now, dear heart!"
-----
"O sweet music from those blissful lips!"
-----
I cried, and stood like a  suppliant before that lovely statue, "sweet music!
-----
drift upon me once  more, dawn once more, dear eyes of light!"
-----
"Speak not so, beloved!"
-----
she cried, "speak to me more seriously,  speak to me with more heart!"
-----
I wanted to restrain myself, but I was as in a dream.
-----
"Alas!"
-----
I cried, "it is no parting from which there is a return."
-----
"You will kill her," cried Notara.
-----
"See how gende she is, and you are so beside yourself."
-----
I looked at her, and tears poured from my burning eyes.
-----
"farewell, then, Diotima!"
-----
I cried, "heaven of my love, farewell!—  Let us be strong, dear friends!
-----
Dear Mother, I gave you joy and  sorrow, farewell, farewell!"
-----
I staggered away.
-----
Diotima alone followed me.
-----
Evening had come, and the stars were rising in the sky.
-----
We  stopped and stood below the house.
-----
There was an eternity within us,  above us.
-----
Delicate as the ether, Diotima embraced me.
-----
"Silly!
-----
what is  parting?"
-----
she whispered mysteriously, with the smile of an immortal.
-----
"I feel differently now, too," I said, "and I do not know which of the two is a dream—my grief or my happiness."
-----
"Both are," she answered, "and both are good."
-----
"Perfect one!"
-----
I cried, "I speak as you do.
-----
Let us know each other by the starry sky.
-----
Let that be the sign between me and you, so long as  our lips are dumb."
-----
"So be it!"
-----
she said, with a lingering tone that I had never heard t  before—it was her last.
-----
Her image vanished from me in the twilight,  and I do not know if it was really she when I turned back for the last    8  time and the fading figure hovered before my eyes a moment longer  and then died into the night.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Why do I recount my grief to you, renew it, and stir up my restless  youth in me again?
-----
Is it not enough to have traveled once through mortality?
-----
why do I not remain still in the peace of my spirit?
-----
It is, my Bellarmin!
-----
because every living breath that we draw  remains dear to our heart, because all the transformations of pure  Nature are part of her beauty too.
-----
Our soul, when it puts off mortal  experiences and lives only in blessed quietness—is it not like a  leafless tree?
-----
like a head without hair?
-----
Dear Bellarmin!
-----
I was quiet  for a while; like a child, I lived under the still knolls of Salamis,  oblivious to mankind's fate and striving.
-----
Since then much has  changed in my eyes, and now I have peace enough in me to remain  quiet when I look at human existence.
-----
O friend!
-----
in the end the Spirit  reconciles us with all things.
-----
You will not believe it, at least not of  me.
-----
But I think that even my letters should suffice to show you that  my soul is becoming more and more still every day.
-----
And I will  continue to tell you of it hereafter, until I have said enough for you to  believe me.
-----
Here are letters of Diotima's and mine, which we wrote to each  other after my departure from Calaurea.
-----
They are the most precious  part of all that I entrust to you.
-----
They are the warmest picture from  those days of my life.
-----
They tell you little of the clamor of war.
-----
But  hence all the more of my own life, and that is what you want.
-----
Ah,  and you must see, too, how greatly I was loved.
-----
That I could never  tell you, that only Diotima can tell.
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  I have awakened from the death of absence, my Diotima!
-----
my spirit  arises, strengthened, as from sleep.
-----
I write to you from a summit in the mountains of Epidaurus.
-----
There, far in the distance, your island looms faintly, Diotima!
-----
out  there, my stadium, where I must conquer or fall O Fbloponnesus!
-----
O  you springs of the Eurotas and Alpheus!
-----
There we shall prove  ourselves.
-----
There, from the forests of Sparta, the ancient genius of the  land will plunge down like an eagle with our army, as on roaring  pinions.
-----
My soul is filled with longing for high deeds and filled with love,  Diotima, and in these Greek valleys my eye looks out as if to  command by magic: "Rise once more, you cities of the gods!"
-----
There must be a god in me, for I scarcely feel our separation.
-----
Like  the blessed shades of Lethe, my soul now lives with yours in heavenly freedom, and Fate has no more power over our love.
-----
/  Hyperion to Diotima  I am now deep in the Peloponnesus.
-----
In the same hut where I spent  last night, I once spent the night when, scarcely more than a boy, I  traveled through these regions with Adamas.
-----
How happily I sat here  then, on the bench in front of the house, listening to die bells of  arriving caravans tinkling in the distance and the plash of the nearby  spring, which poured its silver waters into the basin under flowering  acacias.
-----
Now I am no less happy.
-----
I rove through this land as through  Dodona's grove, where the oaks resounded with oracles prophesying fame.
-----
I see only deeds, past and to come, even though I wander from morning to night under the open sky.
-----
Believe me, he who travels through this land and still tolerates a yoke on his neck,  still becomes no Felopidas: he is empty-hearted or without understanding.
-----
Can this sleep have lasted so long?
-----
so long has time, dark and  dumb as the River of Hell, glided on in drear sloth?
-----
And yet all is ready.
-----
The mountain folk hereabout are full of  vengeful energy; they lie like a silent storm cloud that waits only for  the wind to drive it on.
-----
Diotima!
-----
let me breathe the breath of God  among them; let me speak a word to them from my heart, Diotima.
-----
Fear not!
-----
They will not be so savage.
-----
I know untutored nature.
-----
It    8  scorns reason, but it is close kin to enthusiasm.
-----
H^whoJttit works  with his whole soul never goes wrong.
-----
He need not ponder, for no  power is against him.
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  Tomorrow I shall be with Alabanda.
-----
It is a delight for me to ask the  way to Coron, and I ask more often than I need to.
-----
I would take the  wings of the sun and be off to him, yet I find myself inclined to hang  back and ask, "What will he be like?"
-----
The kingly youth!
-----
why was I born after him?
-----
why did I not spring  from one cradle with him?
-----
I cannot bear the difference between us.
-----
Oh, why did I live in Tina like an idle shepherd boy, and did not even  dream of such a man as he until he was already testing Nature by  living work, already battling sea and air and all the elements?
-----
was  not a longing for the glory of action astir in me then too?
-----
But I will catch up with him; I will be speedy.
-----
By Heaven!
-----
I am  overripe for work.
-----
My soul has only itself to be angry with if I do not  soon free myself by some living action.
-----
Noble maiden!
-----
how could you not find me wanting?
-----
How could  you possibly love a being so empty of deeds?
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  I have him, dear Diotima!
-----
My breast is light, and swift my sinews, ha!
-----
and the future tempts  me, as clear deep water tempts us to leap into it and cool our  exuberant blood in that freshening bath.
-----
But this is idle chatter.
-----
We  are dearer to each other than ever, my Alabanda and I.
-----
We are freer  together, and yet all the fullness and depth of life is there, as it used  tobe.
-----
Oh, how right the tyrants of old were to forbid such friendships as  ours!
-----
Then a man is as strong as a demigod and tolerates no  insolence within his sphere!—  It was evening when I entered his room.
-----
He had just laid aside his  work and was sitting by the window in a moonlit corner, commun-      ing with his thoughts.
-----
I was standing in the dark, he did not  recognize me, he looked toward me unconcernedly.
-----
Heaven knows  who he took me to be.
-----
"Well, how goes it?
-----
* he cried.
-----
"Well  enough,* I said.
-----
But my dissembling availed nothing.
-----
My voice was  filled with secret delight.
-----
"What is Ais?
-----
* he sprang up; "is it you?
-----
*  "Yes, you blindman," I cried, and flew into his arms.
-----
"Oh, now,*  Alabanda cried at last, "now everything will be different, Hyperion!
-----
*  "So I think too,* said I, and happily shook his hand.
-----
"And do you still know me,* Alabanda continued after a time,  "have you still your old devout belief in Alabanda?
-----
Magnanimous  Hyperion!
-----
things have not gone as well for me since, as they did  when I felt the light of your love on me.
-----
*  "What!
-----
* I cried, "can Alabanda ask this?
-----
There was no pride in  those words, Alabanda.
-----
But it is a sign of this age that the old heroic  nature goes begging for respect and die living human heart pines for  a drop of love, like an orphan.
-----
*  "Dear youth!
-----
* he cried; "I have grown old, that is all.
-----
The  slackness of life everywhere, and that matter of the old men with  whom I wanted to put you to school in Smyrna—*  "Oh, it is bitter,* I cried; "the deadly Goddess, the Nameless One  whom men call Fate, has not spared even this man.
-----
*  Lights were brought, and again we looked at each other in cautiously loving scrutiny.
-----
My dear friend's figure had changed very much since those days of hope.
-----
His large, ever-animated eye shone  upon me from his faded face like the midday sun from a pallid  heaven.
-----
"Dear youth!
-----
* cried Alabanda, lovingly vexed to find me staring  at him so, "enough of these dolorous looks, dear youth!
-----
I know very  well that I have sunk.
-----
O my Hyperion!
-----
I long so much for something  great and true and, with you, I hope to find it.
-----
You have outgrown  me, you are freer and stronger than in the past, and, believe me!
-----
it  rejoices my heart.
-----
I am the parched land, and you come like a  fortunate storm—oh, it is glorious that you are here!
-----
*  "Stop!
-----
* I said, "you drive me out of my senses, and we should not  talk of ourselves at all until we are in the midst of life, among  deeds.
-----
*  "Yes, yes!
-----
* Alabanda cried joyously, "not until the horn sounds do  the hunters feel like hunters.
-----
*    8  "Will it start soon, then?"
-----
I said  "It will," cried Alabanda, "and I tell you, dear heart!
-----
it will be quite a fire.
-----
Ha!
-----
may it reach to the tower's top and melt its vane and  rage and swirl about it until it bursts and falls!—and you must not  take offense at our allies.
-----
I know that the good Russians would like  to use us as firearms.
-----
But let that pass!
-----
when our strong Spartans  have once learned in the field who they are and of what they are  capable, when once we have conquered the Peloponnesus with  them, then we will laugh in the North Pole's face and make a life of  our own."
-----
"A life of our own," I cried, "a new, an honorable life.
-----
Were we  born of the swamp, like a will-o'-the-wisp, or are we descended from^  the victors at Salamis?
-----
How is this?
-----
how, O free nature of the  Greeks, have you become a maidservant?
-----
how have you so declined,  ancestral race, of which the divine images of Jupiter and Apollo  were once only the copy?—But hear me, sky of Ionia!
-----
hear me, my  native soil, you that, half naked, dress yourself like a beggarwoman  in the rags of your ancient glory; I will bear it no longer!"
-----
"Oh Sun, who fostered us!"
-----
cried Alabanda, "you shall witness it  when our courage grows under our toil, when our resolution takes  shape under the blows of Fate like iron under the hammer."
-----
Each of us enflamed the other.
-----
"And let no spot remain, none of the abject nonsense with which  this century would smear us as the rabble do the walls!"
-----
"Oh," cried Alabanda, "that is the reason war is so good—"  "Yes, yes, Alabanda," I cried, "even as are all great undertakings, in which men's strength and spirit, not crutches and wings of wax,  are the means.
-----
There we take off the slaves' clothing branded with  the mark which Fate would set upon us—"  "There all that is frivolous, all that is forced, has no more currency," cried Alabanda, "we go stripped of ornaments as of chains, naked as in the races at Nemea, straight to the goal."
-----
"To the goal," I cried, "where the young free state dawns and the pantheon of all Beauty arises from the soil of Greece."
-----
Alabanda was silent for a while.
-----
A new red rose into his face and  his form grew as a plant refreshed.
-----
"O Youth, Youth!"
-----
he cried, "then will I drink from your spring;  then will I live and love.
-----
I am very joyful, Sky of Night," he went on      as if intoxicated, walking to the window, "your vault is over me like  the foliage of a vine, and your stars hang down like clusters of  grapes."
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  It is my good fortune that my life is completely occupied with work.
-----
I should fall into one folly after another, so full is my soul, so am I  intoxicated by the proud, the wonderful man who loves nothing but  me and heaps all the humility that is in him upon me alone.
-----
O  Diotima!
-----
this Alabanda has wept before me, has begged me like a  child to forgive him for what he did to me in Smyrna.
-----
Who am I, you loved ones, that I call you mine, that I dare to say,  uThey are my own," that, like a conqueror, I stand between you and  hold you as my treasure?
-----
O Diotima!
-----
O Älabanda!
-----
noble, calmly great beings!
-----
how much  there is for me to accomplish, if I am not to flee from my happiness,  from you?
-----
Just now, while I was writing, I received your letter, dear one.
-----
Grieve not, lovely being, grieve not!
-----
Rreserve yourself unwithered  by sorrow, for the future festivals of our country!
-----
Diotima, preserve  yourself for the shining celebration of Nature and for all the serene  days set aside to honor the gods!
-----
Do you not see Greece already?
-----
Oh, do you not see how, rejoicing in their new neighbor, the  eternal stars smile over our towns and groves, how the ancient  ocean, when it sees our people wandering happily along the shore,  remembers the beautiful Athenians and speeds good fortune to us  again, as then it did to its favorites, on rejoicing waves?
-----
O soulful  maiden!
-----
you are so beautiful already!
-----
when the true climate nourishes you at last, in what enchanting glory will you not flower!
-----
Diotima to Hyperion  I had shut myself up indoors most of the time since you went away,  dear Hyperion!
-----
Today I went out again.
-----
9  In the sweet February air I gathered life, and I bring you what I  gathered.
-----
It still did me good, die fresh warming of the sky; I still felt  in sympathy with the new joy of the plant world, ever pure, ever the  same, where all things grieve and rejoice again in their time.
-----
Hyperion!
-----
O my Hyperion!
-----
then why do not we too walk the  quiet paths of life?
-----
They are holy names, winter and spring and  summer and autumn!
-----
yet we know them not.
-----
It is not a sin to grieve  in spring?
-----
Why do we, then?
-----
Forgive me!
-----
Earth's children live through die sun alone; I live  through you; I have other joys, so is it any wonder if I have other  griefs?
-----
and must I grieve?
-----
must I?
-----
Brave one!
-----
loved one!
-----
shall I wither while you shine?
-----
shall my  ear  i t grow weary when the joy erf victory wakes in your every vein?
-----
Had I heard in times past that a Greek youth had risen to raise our  good people out of their shame, to give them back the maternal  Beauty from which they are sprung, how I should have started from  the dream of childhood and thirsted for the image of one so  precious!
-----
and now that he is there, now that he is mine, can I still  weep?
-----
Oh, the silly girl!
-----
is it not true?
-----
is he not the glorious one,  and is he not mine!
-----
O you shadows of a blessed time!
-----
you my  beloved memories!
-----
Yet it seems as if it was scarcely yesterday, that magical evening  when the sacred stranger came to me for the first time, when, like a  grieving genius, he shone into the shadows of the wood where the  carefree maiden sat in the dream of youth—in the air erf May he  came, in the enchanting May air erf Ionia, and it made him bloom all  the more, it waved his hair, opened his lips like flowers, dissolved  sorrow in smiles, and O you ray£ erf heaven!
-----
how you shone on me  from those eyes, from those intoxicating springs where in the  shadow of screening brows eternal life shimmers and wells!—  Merciful Gods!
-----
how beautiful he became with his gaze upon me!
-----
how the whole youth, grown a span taller, stood there in easy  strength, save that his dear, modest arms dropped down as if they  were nothing!
-----
and how, then, he looked up in rapture, as if I had  flown into the sky and were no longer there, ah!
-----
how, aware of me  again, his eye shone bright as Phoebus through the darkening tears  and, smiling, he blushed with inborn grace to ask me, "Is it you?
-----
is it  you indeed?"
-----
And why did he come to me with thoughts so devout, so full of  dear superstition?
-----
why did he first stand with bowed head, why was  the divine youth so frill erf shyness and grief?
-----
His genius was too  blessed to remain alone, and the world too poor to comprehend  him.
-----
Oh, it was a dear image, woven erf greatness and sorrow!
-----
But  now it is otherwise!
-----
the sorrowing is over!
-----
He has found work to do,  he is sick no longer!—  I was full of sighs when I began to write to you, my beloved!
-----
Now  I am pure joy.
-----
To talk of you has been to grow happy.
-----
And look!
-----
even  so shall it remain.
-----
Farewell!
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  We have managed to celebrate your birthday, beautiful being!
-----
before  the uproar begins.
-----
It was a heavenly day.
-----
The lovely springtime  wafted and shone from the East, conjured your name from us as it  conjures the flowers from the trees, and all the blessed secrets of love  took my breath away.
-----
My friend had never known of such a love as  ours, and it was ravishing to see how attentive the proud man  became and how his eye and his spirit glowed as they strove to  apprehend your image, your being.
-----
"Oh," he cried at last, "our Greece is well worth fighting for when it still bears such offspring!"
-----
"Yes indeed, my Alabanda," said I; "then we go joyfully into  battle, then a divine fire drives us on to do high deeds when our  spirit is rejuvenated by the image of such natures, then we run for no  petty goal, then we are not concerned for this thing and that thing,  do not tinker with outsides, unheeding the spirit, nor drink the wine  for the .cup's sake, then we will not rest, Alabanda, until the ecstasy  of the Genius is a secret no longer, when all eyes are transformed  into triumphal arches from which man's spirit, long absent, shines  forth out of error and sufferings and greets the paternal ether in the  joy of victory.—Ha!
-----
let no one think to know our people, as they are  to be, from their flag alone; everything must be rejuvenated, everything be changed from the ground up; pleasure must be full erf seriousness, and all work gleeful!
-----
nothing, not even the least and  most commonplace of things, must be without spirit and the gods!
-----
9  Love and hate and every tone from us must make the commoner  world wonder, not a single moment must ever dare to remind us of  the lowly past!"
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  The volcano is erupting.
-----
The Turks are besieged in Coron and  Modon and we are pushing on against the Peloponnesus with our  mountaineers.
-----
Now all depression is ended, Diotima, and my spirit is firmer and  swifter since I am occupied with vital work and yes!
-----
I now even have  a daily schedule.
-----
I begin with the sun.
-----
I go out to where my troops are lying in the  shadow of the woods and greet the thousand clear eyes that now  open to me with wild affection.
-----
An awakening army!
-----
I know of  nothing like it and all the life of towns and villages is like a swarm of  bees in comparison.
-----
Man cannot hide it from himself: once he was happy, like the deer  in the forest, and even now, after untold years, there rises in us a  longing for the days of the primal world, when he roved over the  earth like a god, before I know not what tamed man, and, instead of  walls and dead wood, the soul of the World, sacred Air, still  wrapped him in its universal presence.
-----
Diotima!
-----
I am often filled with wonder when I go about among  my carefree men and one after another stands up as if sprung from  the earth and stretches himself toward the dawn, and among the  martial groups the crackling flame rises, where the mother sits with  the freezing infant, where die restoring dish is cooking, while the  horses, sniffing the day, snort and whinny, and the wood resounds  with shattering military music, and everywhere glitters and rings  with weapons—but these are words, and the unique pleasure of  such a life cannot be told.
-----
Then my troop gathers eagerly around me, and it is wonderful  how even the oldest and most recalcitrant respect me, despite my  youth.
-----
We become more and more intimate, and many of them tell  me what their lives have been, and my heart often swells with their      so various fates.
-----
Then I begin to speak of better days, and their eyes  open wide and shine when they think of the covenant that will unite  us, and the proud image of the free state that is soon to be looms  before them.
-----
All for one and one for all!
-----
There is a joyous spirit in the words,  and it takes possession of my men, too, like a divine decree.
-----
O  Diotima!
-----
to see how their stubborn natures are softened by hopes,  and all their pulses beat more strongly, and the burdened brow is  smoothed and cleared by planning!
-----
to stand there in a sphere of  men, surrounded by faith and joy—-that is more, far more, than to  behold earth and sky and sea in all their glory.
-----
Then I drill them in weapons and marching until toward noon.
-----
The happy mood makes them eager pupils, as it makes me a teacher.
-----
Now they stand close together in the Macedonian phalanx, moving  only their arms; now like rays they fly in different directions to more  hazardous combat in separate squads, where their flexible strength  changes with every position and each is his own general, then  assemble again in a place of safety—-and always, wherever they go or  stand in this sort of war dance, before their eyes and mine floats the  image of the tyrant's cohorts and the field of real battle.
-----
Then, when the sun shines hotter, we hold council deep in the  wood, and it is a joy thus in quiet thought to determine our great  future.
-----
We strip chance of its power; we^jnasterjdestiny.
-----
We let  resistance arise as suits our purpose; we lure the enemy into actions  for which we are prepared.
-----
Or we bide our time and appear to be  afraid, and let him come nearer until he exposes his head to our  blow, or we utterly disconcert him with our speed, and that is my  panacea.
-----
But the more experienced physicians do not hold with  such a cure.
-----
s  After that, how good I feel in the evening, with my Alabanda,  when we rove for pleasure around the sun-red hills on our spirited  horses, and on the summits where we linger, the wind plays in the  manes of our mounts and the soothing rustle mingles with our talk,  while we gaze into the distances of Sparta, which are the prize for  which we shall fight!
-----
and then when we have returned and sit  together in the pleasant cool of the night, and the winecup is sweet  in our nostrils and the moon's rays light our frugal meal, and amid    9  our smiling silence, the history of the men of old rises like a cloud  from the soil that bears us, how blissful it is in such moments to  grasp each other's hands!
-----
Then perhaps Alabanda speaks of many another whom the ennui  of this century torments, of so many a strangely crooked course that  life takes, now that its straight path has been blocked, and then I  think, too, of my Adamas, with his journeyings, his strange longing  for the innermost parts of Asia—"These are but stopgaps, dear old  man," I would cry to him now, "come!
-----
and build your world!
-----
with  us!
-----
for our world is yours, too."
-----
And yours, too, Diotima, for it is copied after you.
-----
O you, with  your Elysian quiet, could we but create that which you are!
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  We have now won three battles in succession—small ones, to be  sure, but in them the combatants collided like thunderbolts and all  was one consuming flame.
-----
Navarin is ours, and we are now before  the fortress of Mistra, that remnant of ancient Sparta.
-----
And the flag  that I wrested from an Albanian horde, I have planted on a ruin that  lies before the city, and in my joy have thrown my Turkish turban  into the Eurotas and since then wear the Greek casque.
-----
And now would that I could see you, O maiden!
-----
that I could see  you and take your hands and press them to my heart, whose joy will  soon perhaps be too great!
-----
soon!
-----
in a week perhaps the old, noble  land will be set free, the sacred Peloponnesus.
-----
Then, O precious one, teach me to be pious!
-----
then teach my  overflowing heart a prayer!
-----
I should be silent, for what have I done?
-----
and if I had done anything worth speaking of, how much is nonethe-  less left to do!
-----
But how can I help it if my thought is swifter than  time?
-----
I wish so much that it were the other way around, that time  and the deed overtook the thought, that winged victory outstripped  the hope itself.
-----
My Alabanda blooms like a bridegroom.
-----
From his every look the  coming world smiles at me, and with that 1 still quiet my impatience  somewhat.
-----
Diotima!
-----
I would not change this budding happiness for the most  beautiful life that was ever lived in ancient Greece, and the smallest  of our victories is dearer to me than Marathon and Thermopylae  and Plataea.
-----
Is it not true?
-----
is not life recovering health more cherished than the pure life that has not yet known sickness?
-----
Not until youth is gone do we love it, not until whatlia§.^enj^ remnis3Qe$  it rejoice all the depths of the soul«  My tent is pitched beside the Eurotas, and when I wake up after  midnight the ancient River God roars past exhorting me, and,  staffing, I pick the flowers on the bank and throw them into his  Shining waves and say to him: "Take it as a sign, thou lonely one!
-----
Soon die old life will bloom around thee again."
-----
Diotima to Hyperion  I have received die letters, my Hyperion, that you have written me  along your way You move me powerfully by all that you say, and in  die midst of my love I often shudder to see thejei^ej?puth jwho  wept at my feet transformed into this robust being., " """  Will you not forget all tEat you havelearaedol: love?
-----
But change as you will!
-----
I follow you.
-----
I believe that if you could  hate me, I, too, should even come to feel as you felt, would make an  effort to hate you, and so our souls would remain alike—and this  that I say is no exaggeration, Hyperion.
-----
I, too, am wholly different from what I was.
-----
I have lost my serene  view of the world and my free delight in everything that has life.
-----
Only the field of the stars still draws my eyes.
-----
On the other hand, I  think all the more fondly of the great spirits of the past and how they  ended on earth, and the noble women of Sparta have won my heart.
-----
With all this, I do not forget the new champions, the strong whose  hour has come, I often hear their shouts of victory through the  Peloponnesus roar nearer and nearer to me, I often see them surging  down like a cataract through the woods of Epidaurus, and their  weapons glitter far off in the sunlight that guides them on like a  herald, O my Hyperion!
-----
and you come swiftly across to Calaurea  and greet the quiet woods of our love, greet me, and then fly back to    9  your work;—and do you think I fear for the outcome!
-----
Dearest!
-----
often  I am close to being troubled, but my nobler thoughts are like flames  and hold off the chill.—  Farewell!
-----
Accomplish what the spirit bids you!
-----
and let not the war  go on too long, for peace's sake, Hyperion, for the sake of the  beautiful, new, golden peace, when, as you said, the laws of Nature  will yet be written in our statute book, and when life itself, when  divine Nature, that can be written in no book, will dwell in the  hearts of the community.
-----
Farewell.
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  You should have calmed me, my Diotima!
-----
should have said that I  must not go too fast, must extort victory from Fate little by little, as  what they owe is wrung from impecunious debtors.
-----
O maiden!
-----
to  stand still is worse than anything.
-----
My blood dries up in my veins, I  so thirst to go forward, and must stand here idle, laying siege day in  and day out.
-----
Our men want to storm, but that would heat their  excited spirits to frenzy, and alas!
-----
then for our hopes, if every  savagery erupts and bursts the bonds of discipline and love.
-----
I do not know, it can be but a few days longer before Mistra must  surrender, but I wish we were farther forward.
-----
Here in the camp I  feel as if I were in the atmosphere of a brewing storm.
-----
I am impatient, and my men are not to my liking.
-----
There is a recklessness among them that is terrifying.
-----
But I am stupid to make so much of my state of mind.
-----
Yes, a little  concern is a cheap price to pay for making ancient Lacedaemon  ours.
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  It is over, Diotima!
-----
our men have plundered, murdered, indiscriminately, even our brothers were killed, the innocent Greeks in Mistra, or they wander helplessly about, their deathly faces calling  Heaven and Earth to wreak vengeance on the barbarians, whose  leader I was.
-----
Now indeed I can go forth and preach my good cause.
-----
Oh now  indeed all hearts will fly to me!
-----
How cleverly I went about it.
-----
How well I knew my men.
-----
Yes!
-----
it  was indeed a remarkable undertaking, to establish my Elysium with  a pack of thieves!
-----
No!
-----
by sacred Nemesis!
-----
I have got what I deserved, and I will bear  it too, bear it until the pain destroys my last consciousness.
-----
Do you think I am raving?
-----
I have an honorable wound, which one  of my faithful followers gave me while I was trying to avert the  horror.
-----
If I were raving, I would tear the bandage from it, and then  my blood would run where it should—into this sorrowing soil.
-----
This sorrowing soil!
-----
whose nakedness J_sought to clothe with  sacred groves!
-----
this soil which I sought to adorn with all the flowers  of Greek life!
-----
Oh, it would have been beautiful, my Diotima!
-----
Do you tell me I have lost faith?
-----
Dear girl!
-----
the evil is too great.
-----
Bands of madmen are bursting in on every side; rapacity rages like  the plague in Morea, and he who does not also take the sword is  hunted down and slain, and the maniacs say they are fighting for our  freedom.
-----
Others of these wild men are paid by die Sultan and do the  same things.
-----
I have just heard that our dishonored army is now scattered.
-----
The  cowards encountered a troop of Albanians near Tripolissa, only half  as many as themselves.
-----
But since there was nothing to plunder, the  wretches all ran away.
-----
Only the Russians who risked this campaign  with us, forty brave men, put up a resistance, and they all found  death.
-----
So now lam again alone with my Alabanda, as before.
-----
Ever since  he saw me fall and bleed in Mistra, that true-hearted friend has  forgotten everything else—his hopes, his longing for victory, his  despair.
-----
He who in his fury came down upon the plunderers like an  avenging god, he led me out of the fight so gendy, and his tears wet  my clothes.
-----
He stayed with me, too, in the hut where I have lain  since then, and only now am I glad that he did so.
-----
For had he gone  on, he would now be lying in the dust before Tripolissa.
-----
What is to follow I know not.
-----
Fate casts me adrift in uncertainty,  and I have deserved it; my own feeling of shame banishes me from  you, and who knows for how long?
-----
9  Ah!
-----
I promised you a Greece, and instead you receive only an  elegy.
-----
Be your own consolation!
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  I can scarcely bring myself to speak.
-----
To be sure, men delight in speaking, they chatter away like the  birds, so long as the world breathes upon them like the air of May;  but between noon and evening that can change, and what is lost in  the end?
-----
Believe me, and consider that I say it to you from the depths of my  soul: speech is a great superfluity.
-----
The best is ever for itself, and rests  in its own depth like the pearl at the bottom of the sea.—But what I  really wanted to write to you is this: because the painting needs its  frame and man his daily work, I am now going to take service for a  time in the Russian fleet; for I have nothing more to do with the  Greeks.
-----
O dear girl!
-----
It has grown very dark around me!
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  I have hesitated, I have struggled.
-----
But now at last it must be.
-----
I see what is necessary.
-----
And since I see it, it shall come to pass.
-----
Do  not misunderstand me!
-----
do not condemn me!
-----
I must advise you to  give me up, my Diotima.
-----
I am nothing more for you, lovely being!
-----
This heart has dried up  toward you, and my eyes no more see what has life.
-----
Oh, my lips have  withered; the sweet breath of love no longer wells up in my breast.
-----
One day has taken all my youth from me; beside the Eurotas my  life wept itself weary, ah!
-----
beside the Eurotas which, in irreparable  dishonor, goes mourning with its every wave past Lacedaemon's  ruins.
-----
There, there did Fate mow down my harvest.—Am I to have  your love as an alms?—I am as utterly nothing, as inglorious, as the  most wretched serf.
-----
I am banished, cursed, like a common rebel,  and many a Greek in Morea will hereafter narrate our heroic deeds  to his children's children as a tale of thieves.
-----
And, ah!
-----
I have long kept one thing from you.
-----
My father has  solemnly disowned me, banished me irrevocably from the home of  my youth; he will never see me again, either in this life or the next, as  he puts i t So reads die answer to the letter in which I wrote to him  of my undertaking.
-----
But let not pity, now or ever, lead you astray.
-----
Believe me, there is  one joy left for us everywhere.
-----
True grief inspires.
-----
He who steps on  his misery stands higher.
-----
And it is glorious that only in suffering do  we truly feel freedom of soul.
-----
Freedom!
-----
if any understand the  word—it is a deep word, Diotima.
-----
I am so inwardly assailed, so  extraordinarily hurt, I am without hope, without a goal, utterly  dishonored, and yet there is a power in me, something indomitable,  that sets my frame sweetly trembling whenever it awakes in me.
-----
And I still have my Alabanda.
-----
He has as little to gain as I have.
-----
I  can keep him for myself without injuring him.
-----
Ah!
-----
the kingly youth  would have deserved a better lot.
-----
He has become so gentle and so  quiet.
-----
It often comes near to breaking my heart.
-----
But each of us  sustains the other.
-----
We do not talk together; what should we say?
-----
but  there is a blessing in many little affectionate things that we do for  each other.
-----
There he sleeps, smiling resignedly, in all our misfortune.
-----
The  good soul!
-----
he does not know what I am doing.
-----
He would not  tolerate it.
-----
"You must write to Diotima," he ordered me, "and tell her to be ready soon to fly with you to a more endurable country."
-----
But he does not know that a heart that has learned to despair like his  and like mine is nothing more for its beloved.
-----
No!
-----
no!
-----
you would  forever find no peace with Hyperion, you could not but be unfaithful, and that I shall spare you.
-----
And so farewell, sweet maid!
-----
farewell!
-----
Would that I could say to  you: "Go here, go there; there the springs erf life murmur."
-----
Would  that I could show you a freer country, a country filled with beauty  and soul, and say: "Escape there."
-----
But, O Heaven!
-----
if I could do that,  I should be other than I am, and then I should not need to take my  leave—take leave?
-----
Ah, I know not what I am doing.
-----
I thought that I  was so self-possessed, so cool-headed.
-----
Now my brain reels, my heart  tosses like an impatient sick man.
-----
woe to me!
-----
I am destroying my  last happiness.
-----
But it must be, and mortal nature's "Alas!"
-----
is unavailing here.
-----
I owe it to you, and, besides that, I was born to be homeless    10  and without a resting place.
-----
O Earth!
-----
O you Stars!
-----
shall I find  nowhere to abide, even to the end?
-----
Could I but once return to your arms, no matter where!
-----
Eyes clear as the ether!
-----
could I but once again find myself in you!
-----
hang on  those lips of yours, O lovable, inexpressible one!
-----
and drink down  your ravishing, blessed sweet life—but listen not to this!
-----
I implore  you, heed it not!
-----
If you listened, I should say I am a seducer.
-----
You  know me, you understand me.
-----
You recognize what deep respect you  pay me, if you do not pity me, do not listen to me.
-----
I can, I may no more—how should the priest live when his God is  no more?
-----
O Genius of my people!
-----
O Soul of Greece!
-----
I must descend,  I must seek you in the realm of the dead.
-----
Hyperion to Diotima  I have waited long, I will confess to you; I have hoped anxiously for a  parting word from your heart, but you are silent.
-----
That, too, is a  language of your beautiful soul, Diotima.
-----
Is it not true that the more sacred harmonies do not therefore  cease?
-----
is it not true, Diotima, that even when the soft moonlight of  love sets, the higher stars of its heaven still shine on?
-----
Oh, that is  indeed my last joy, that we are inseparable, even if no sound returns  to me from you, no shadow of our fair young days.
-----
I gaze out to the reddened sea of evening; I stretch my arms  toward the far place where you live, and my soul is warmed once  again by all the joys of love and youth.
-----
O Earth!
-----
my cradle!
-----
all bliss and all sorrow is in our leave-taking  from you!
-----
You dear Ionian islands!
-----
and you, my Calaurea, and you, my  Una, you are all before my eyes, distant though you be, and my  .
-----
spirit flies with the breeze over the moving waters; and you that  loom dimly over there, you shores of Teos and Ephesus, where once  I walked with Alabanda in the days of hope, you appear to me again  as in that time, and I would sail across to the mainland and kiss that  soil and warm it at my breast and stammer out all sweet words of  farewell to the silent Earth, before I fly up into freedom.
-----
Alas, alas, that things are not now better among mankind!
-----
were it    1  otherwise, I would gladly remain upon this goodly star.
-----
But I can  forego this globe of the Earth, and that is more than all that it can  give.
-----
"Let us bear slavery, O child, in the light of the Sun," said her  mother to Polyxena, and her love of life could find no more beautiful  expression.
-----
But it is the light of the Sun that exhorts me not to bear  slavery, that will not let me remain upon the degraded Earth, and his  holy rays draw me on, like paths that lead home.
-----
Long since has the majesty of the soul that is outside of Fate been  more present to me than anything else; I have often lived within.
-----
myself in glorious solitude; I have grown used to shaking off outside  "things like flakes of snow; why, then, should I be afraid to seek so*  called death?
-----
have I not freed myself a thousand times in thought?
-----
why should I hesitate to do it once in reality?
-----
Are we like slaves, then, bound to the soil that we plow?
-----
are we like barnyard fowls,  which dare not run out of the courtyard because they are fed there?
-----
We are like young eagles whose father drives them out of the nest  that they may seek their prey in the high ether.
-----
Tomorrow our fleet goes into action, and the fight will be hot  enough.
-----
I look on this battle as a bath that will wash the dust from  me; and I shall doubdess find what I wish for; wishes like mine are  easily granted, and on the spot.
-----
And so I should have gained something after all from my campaign, and behold!
-----
no effort that man makes is wholly in vain.
-----
Devout soul!
-----
I would say, "Think of me when you come upon my  grave."
-----
But they will doubdess throw me into the sea, and I am  content to have my remains sink down where the springs and all the  rivers that I loved gather together, and where the storm cloud arises  to drench the mountains and the valleys that I loved.
-----
And we?
-----
O  Diotima!
-----
Diotima!
-----
when shall we see each other once again?
-----
It is impossible, and my inmost life rebels if I try to think that we  are lost to each other.
-----
I would wander among the stars for millenniums, clothe myself in all forms, in all the languages of life, that I might meet you once again.
-----
But I think that what is alike is soon united.
-----
Great soul!
-----
you will be able to reconcile yourself to this parting,  and so let me be off on my journey!
-----
Greet your mother!
-----
greet Notara  and our other friends!
-----
10  And greet the trees where I found you before me for the first time  and the joyous brooks where we walked and the lovely gardens of  Angele, and, dear one, let my image be before you.
-----
Farewell.
-----
Book Two  Hyperion to Bellarmin  I was in a lovely dream when I copied out for you the letters that I  once exchanged.
-----
Now I write to you again, my Bellarmin!
-----
and  lead you yet further down, down into the deepest depth of my  sorrow, and then, you last of my loves!
-----
come out with me again, to  the place where a new day shines upon us.
-----
The battle of which I had written to Diotima began.
-----
The Turkish  ships had withdrawn into the strait between die island of Chios and  the Asiatic coast, and had taken up a position along die mainland  near Cheshme.
-----
My admiral left the line with his ship, on which I  was, and began the prelude with the first Turkish ship.
-----
The enraged  pair were heated to frenzy at the very first attack; it was an intoxication of revenge, a terrible battle.
-----
The ships were soon fast together by their rigging; die furious fight was ever at closer quarters.
-----
A profound sense of life still pervaded me.
-----
I felt warm and good in  every limb.
-----
My spirit, like one taking tender leave, was aware of itself  for the last time in all its senses.
-----
And now, filled with hot disgust at  knowing nothing better than to let myself be slaughtered in a crush  of barbarians, I rushed on, with tears of rage in my eyes, to where  certain death awaited me.
-----
I had not far to seek for the enemy, and it was not many minutes  before, of the Russians who were fighting beside me, not even one  was left.
-----
I stood there alone, filled with pride, and flung my life  down before the barbarians like a beggar's penny; but they would  have none of me.
-----
They looked at me as at a man whom one is afraid  to offend, and Bate seemed to feel consideration for me in my  despair.
-----
In desperate self-defense, one of them at last aimed a blow at me,    3  striking me so that I fell.
-----
After that I knew nothing, until I came to  my senses again in Faros, to which I had been brought by ship»  Brom the servant who carried me out of the battle I later heard  that the two ships that had begun the fight had blown up the  moment after he and the surgeon had taken me off in a boat.
-----
The  Russians had thrown fire into the Turkish ship; and since theirs was  fast to the other, it had burned too.
-----
How this terrible battle ended, you know.
-----
"Thus one poison  wreaks vengeance upon the other," I cried, when I learned that the  Russians had burned the entire Turkish fleet— "thus do tyrants  exterminate themselves."
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  Six days after the battle I lay in a tortured, deathly sleep.
-----
My life was  like a night interrupted by pains as from flashing lightning.
-----
My first  returning consciousness was of Alabanda.
-----
He had not—so I  learned—stirred from my side for an instant, had taken care of me  almost single-handed, with incredible assiduity, with a thousand  tender, homely services of which he would otherwise never in his life  have thought, and he had been heard to cry, on his knees beside my  bed: "O live, my loved one, that I may live!
-----
It was a happy awakening, Bellarmin!
-----
when my eyes opened to the  light again, and the glorious youth stood before me with tears of  emotion at our reunion.
-----
I held out my hand, and, proud as he was, he kissed it with all the  rapture of love.
-----
"He lives,** he cried, "O Nature!
-----
O kindly, all-  healing savior!
-----
you do not, will not forsake your wretched pair, your  wanderers without a country.
-----
O Hyperion!
-----
never will I forget seeing  your ship go up in fire before my eyes and, thundering, carry the  sailors with it in raging flame, and among the few who were saved  there was no Hyperion.
-----
I was out of my mind, and the fierce clamor  of battle did not quiet me.
-----
But I soon heard news of you and flew  after you as soon as we had finished with the enemy.
-----
"—  And how he watched over me now!
-----
with what loving caution he  kept me imprisoned in the magic circle of his kind services!
-----
how,    10  without a word, he taught me by his great quietude to understand  the free course of the world without envy and like a man!
-----
O you sons of the Sun!
-----
you freer souls!
-----
much has been lost in this  Alabanda.
-----
I sought in vain, in vain I prayed to Life; since he is gone,  such a Roman nature I have never found.
-----
Untroubled, profoundly  understanding, brave, noble Alabanda!
-----
where is there a man if he  was not one?
-----
And when he was friendly and simple, it was as when  the light of evening plays through the darkness of die majestic oak  and its leaves drip with the rainstorm of the day  Hyperion to Bellarmin  It was in the beautiful days of autumn that, half recovered from my  wound, I made my way to the window again for the first time.
-----
I  returned to life with calmer senses and my soul had grown more  attentive.
-----
The air of heaven breathed its most delicate magic upon  me, and the serene sunbeams poured down as mildly as a rain of  flowers.
-----
There was a great, quiet, tender spirit in the season, and  among the rustling twigs the peace of completion, the bliss of  maturity surrounded me like the renewed youth for which the Ancients hoped in their Elysium.
-----
It had been long since I had enjoyed it in purity of soul, this  childlike love of the world; now my eyes opened with all the joy of  recognition and blessed Nature had remained unchanged in her  beauty.
-----
My tears flowed before her like an atoning sacrifice, and a  heart renewed rose tremblingly from my old discontent "O holy  world of plants!"
-----
I cried, "we struggle and take thought, and yet  have you!
-----
with our mortal powers we strive to cultivate the Beautiful,  yet it grows light-heartedly beside us!
-----
Is it not so, Alabanda?
-----
men  are made to provide for their necessities; all else is freely given.
-----
And  yet—I cannot forget how much more I wanted."
-----
"Let it suffice you, dear one, that you exist," cried Alabanda, "and let grieving no longer hinder what is quietly at work within you."
-----
"Yes, I will rest," said I.
-----
"Oh, I will tear up all those projects, all those claims, like promissory notes.
-----
I will keep myself pure, as an    5  artist keeps himself; you will I love, innocent Life, Life of the grove  and the spring!
-----
you will I honor, O light of the Sun!
-----
by you will I  calm myself, beautiful Ether, which givest life to the stars and yet  here breathest about these trees and here touchest us in the depths  of our hearts!
-----
O willfulness of men!
-----
I have bowed my neck like a  beggar, and the Gods of Nature watched me in silence with all their  gifts!—Do you smile, Alabanda?
-----
Oh how often, in our earliest days,  did you smile so when your lad chattered to you in the intoxicated  pride of youth, the while you stood like a quiet temple pillar amid  the rubble of the world and could not but süßer the wild tendrils of  my love to grow about you—see what a blindfold falls from my eyes,  and the old golden days are here and live again!"
-----
"Ah!"
-----
he cried, "the earnestness that was ours, and the joy of life!"
-----
"When we hunted in the forest," I cried, "when we bathed in the  sea, when we sang and drank, and through the laurel shade the sun  and the wine and our eyes and our lips were bright—that was a life  without equal and our spirit illuminated our youthful happiness like  a shining heaven."
-----
"And therefore neither of us can abandon the  other," said Alabanda.
-----
"Oh, I have a heavy confession to make to you," said L "Will you  believe that I wanted to go away?
-----
from you!
-----
that I sought my death  by sheer strength?
-----
was that not heartless?
-----
madness?
-----
ah, and my  Diotima!
-----
she must leave me, I wrote to her, and after that another  letter, the evening before the battle—* "and you wrote in it," he  cried, "that you would seek your end in the battle?
-----
O Hyperion!
-----
But  she cannot yet have received that last letter.
-----
You must write to her,  quickly, that you are still alive."
-----
aBest Alabanda!"
-----
I cried.
-----
aYou comfort me indeed!
-----
I will write at  once and send my servant off with it.
-----
Oh, I will offer him all that I  have to hurry and reach Calaurea while it is still time.
-----
"—  "And the other letter, in which you wrote of renunciation—the  good soul will easily understand and forgive you for that," he added.
-----
"Does she forgive?"
-----
I cried; "O all you hopes!
-----
yes!
-----
if I could still be happy with that angel!"
-----
"You will still be happy," cried Alabanda; "the most beautiful age of life is yet left to you.
-----
The youth is a hero, the man a god, if he can  live to see it"    10  A wondrous light dawned in my soul as he spoke.
-----
The tops of the trees stirred softly; like flowers from the dark  earth, stars sprouted from the womb of night and the springtime of  the heavens shone on me in holy joy.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  A few minutes later, just as I was about to write to Diotima,  Alabanda came joyfully back into the room.
-----
"A letter, Hyperion!"
-----
he cried; I gave a start and flew to it.
-----
"How long," wrote Diotima, "I had to live without a sign from  you!
-----
You wrote me about the fatal day at Mistra, and I answered  speedily; but everything would indicate that you did not receive my  letter.
-----
Immediately afterward you wrote to me again, briefly and  gloomily, and said you were of a mind to join the Russian fleet; I  answered again; but that letter did not reach you either; now I, too,  waited in vain, from May to the end of summer, until some days ago  the letter arrived which tells me I should renounce you, beloved!
-----
"You relied on me, had enough trust in me to believe that your  letter could not offend me.
-----
That made me heartily glad, even in my  distress.
-----
"Unhappy, lofty spirit!
-----
I have understood you only too well.
-----
Oh, it  is so completely natural that you will not love, because your greater  wishes are dying a lingering death.
-----
Must you not scorn food when  you are perishing of thirst?
-----
"I soon understood; I could not be all to you.
-----
Could I loose the  bonds of mortality for you?
-----
could I quiet the flame in your breast,  that flame for which no spring flows and no vine bears grapes?
-----
could I offer you the joys of the world in a scallop shell?
-----
"That is what you want.
-----
That is what you need, and you cannot do  otherwise.
-----
The unbounded impotence of your contemporaries has  robbed you of your life.
-----
"He who, like you, has been hurt to the depths of his soul can no  longer find rest in an individual joy, he who, like you, has felt  nothingness in all its vapidity finds exhilaration only in the highest  spirit, he who has experienced death as you did recovers only  among the gods.
-----
7  "They are fortunate—all those who do not understand you!
-----
He  who understands you must share in your greatness and in your  despair.
-----
"I found you as you are.
-----
Life's first curiosity impelled me toward  that wonderful being.
-----
Your tender soul drew me inexpressibly on,  with the fearlessness of a child I played about your dangerous  flame.—The beautiful joys of our love softened you; but only, wicked  man!
-----
to make you the more savage.
-----
They soothed, they solaced me,  too, they made me forget that you were essentially inconsolable, and  that I, too, was not far from becoming so ever since I had looked into  your beloved heart  "In Athens, beside the ruins of the Olympieion, it came over me  again.
-----
In carefree hours, it is true, I had been thinking: This youth's  sorrow is not perhaps so deep and inexorable.
-----
It is so seldom that a  man, at his first step into life, has at once so suddenly, so minutely, so quickly, so deeply felt the whole inevitable course of his time, and  that this feeling is so ineradicably fixed in him because he is not  rugged enough to cast it out and not weak enough to weep it away—  that, my dear one, is so unusual that we think it almost out of the  course of Nature.
-----
"Now, in the rubble of serene Athens, it came home to me all too  grievously: the leaf has been turned, the dead now walk the earth  and the living, the divine men, are under it, now I saw it all too  literally and all too really written on your face, now I admitted that  you were eternally right.
-----
But at the same moment I saw you greater.
-----
A being filled with secret strength, filled with a deep, undeveloped  significance, a youth uniquely promising—thus you appeared to me.
-----
'He to whom Destiny speaks so loudly has the right to speak yet  more loudly to Destiny,91 told myself; "the more unfathomably he  suffers, the more unfathomably strong he is.'
-----
Brom you, from you  alone, I hoped for all restoration.
-----
I saw you traveling.
-----
I saw you  working.
-----
Oh, the transformation!
-----
Established by you, the grove of  Academe spread green again over listening pupils, and the plane tree  of the Ilissus heard sacred conversations, as of old.
-----
"In your school the genius of our youths soon acquired the  seriousness of the Ancients, and its transitory games became more  nearly immortal, for it felt ashamed, deemed its butterfly flight a  prison.—    10  "To manage a horse would have sufficed one of them; now he is a  general.
-----
Only too contentedly would another have sung an idle  song; now he is an artist.
-----
For you had revealed the powers of the  heroes, the powers of the world to them in open battle; you had  given them die riddles of your heart to solve; so the youths learned  to bring together great things, learned to understand the living play  of Nature, and forgot jesting.—Hyperion!
-----
Hyperion!
-----
did you not  make me, immature as I was, a Muse?
-----
So it was, too, with the  others.
-----
"Ah!
-----
now men, born to companionship» did not so easily forsake  one another; no longer did they wander in mutual confusion, like  sand in the desert storm, nor did youth and age mock each other,  nor did the stranger lack a hospitable host, and fellow countrymen  no longer stood aside, and lovers no longer tired of each other; at  your springs, Nature, they refreshed themselves, ah!
-----
at the sacred  joys that pour secretly from your depths and renew the spirit; and  the gods restored to the souls of men the joy without which they  wither away; the heart-sustaining gods were guardians of every bond  of friendship.
-----
For you, Hyperion!
-----
had healed the eyes of your Greeks  so that they saw the living, you had kindled the enthusiasm that slept  in them like fire in wood so that they felt the still, never-failing  enthusiasm of Nature and of her pure children.
-----
Ah!
-----
now men no  longer took the beautiful world as the uninitiated take the artist's  poem when they praise the words of it and look for profit in them.
-----
O  living Nature, you became a magical example tQ the Greeks, and*  fired by the happiness of the ever-young gods, all the activities of  men were, as ofoTdTä festival; and more beautiful than martial  müsic,MHeiios> H^ST^scofteä the young heroes to high deeds.
-----
"Enough!
-----
enough!
-----
it was my most beautiful dream, my first and  my last.
-----
You are too proud any longer to concern yourself with this  villainous race.
-----
And you are right.
-----
You led them to freedom, and  they thought of robbery.
-----
You led them victoriously into their ancient  Lacedaemon, and these monsters fall to plundering and you are  cursed by your father, great son!
-----
and no wilderness, no cave is safe  enough for you on this Greek soil that you revered as a sacred shrine,  that you loved more than you loved me.
-----
"O my Hyperion!
-----
I am no longer the gentle maiden, since I have  learned all this.
-----
Indignation bears me upward so that I can hardly    9  see down to the Earth, and my offended heart trembles incessantly.
-----
,  "We will part.
-----
You are right.
-----
And I want no children; for I will not  bestow them on this world of slaves, and besides, the poor plants  would wither away before my eyes in this drought.
-----
"Farewell, dear youth!
-----
go wherever you think it worth going to  yield up your soul.
-----
The world must yet have one battlefield, one  place of sacrifice, where you can free yoursell It would be a shame if  all these goodly powers but vanished like a dream.
-----
But however you  find your end, you return to the gods, return into the sacred, free,  youthful life erf Nature, whence you came, and that is your desire as  it is mine."
-----
So she wrote to me.
-----
I was stricken to the core, filled with terror  and joy, but I tried to control myself and find words in which to  answer.
-----
"You assent, Diorima?"
-----
I wrote, "you approve of my renunciation?
-----
you could understand it?—Loyal soul!
-----
you could reconcile yourself to it?
-----
could reconcile yourself even to my dark wanderings,  in your heavenly patience?
-----
you submitted, eclipsed yourself for love,  happy child of Nature?
-----
became like me and by your concurrence  sanctified my grief?
-----
Beautiful heroine!
-----
what crown did you not earn?
-----
"But now let there be enough of grieving, O loved one!
-----
You have  followed me into my darkness, now come!
-----
and let me follow you to  your light, let us return to your graces, beautiful heart!
-----
oh, let me  look upon your calm once again, blessed nature!
-----
let me lull my  discontent to sleep forever before you, image of peace!
-----
"Is it not true, dear one!
-----
it is not too late for me to return even  now?
-----
and you will take me back and can love me again, as before?
-----
is  it not true that the happiness of past days is not lost to us?
-----
"I have behaved unconscionably.
-----
I have dealt most ungratefully  with Mother Earth; my blood and all the gifts of love that she gave  me, I have thrown away like the base wage of a serf, and ah!
-----
how  many thousand times more ungrateful have I been to you, O sacred  maiden!
-----
who once received me into her peace, me, a shy, lacerated  being from whose sorely oppressed heart scarcely a glimmer of  youth stole forth, as here and there a grass blade steals up from  trodden paths.
-----
Had you not called me to life?
-----
was I not yours?
-----
then  how could I—oh, you know not yet, I hope, it has not reached your  hands, the unhappy letter that I wrote to you before the last battle?
-----
I    11  wanted to die then, Diotima, and I thought thus to perform a sacred  act.
-----
But how can that be sacred which parts lovers?
-----
how can that be  sacred which destroys the innocent happiness erf our lives?—O  Diotima!
-----
O life born in beauty!
-----
now I have become all die more like  you in what is most uniquely yourself, I have at last learned to value,  I have learned to guard, what is good and intrinsic on earth.
-----
Oh,  even if I could land up there, on the shining islands erf the sky,  should I find more than I find in Diotima?
-----
"Hear me now, beloved!
-----
"In Greece I can remain no longer.
-----
That you know.
-----
When he  dismissed me my father sent me enough out of what he could spare  to enable us to flee to some blessed valley in the Alps or the Pyrenees  and there to buy a pleasant house and with it as much green ground  as life's golden mean requires.
-----
"If you are willing, I will come at once and conduct you and your  mother with a loyal arm, we will kiss the shore erf Calaurea and dry  our tears and hasten across the Isthmus to the Adriatic Sea, where a  safe ship will take us farther.
-----
"Oh come!
-----
in the depths of the mountain world the secret of our  hearts will rest like the precious stone in the mine; in the bosom of  woods that tower to the sky we shall be as among the pillars of the  inmost temple, where the godless draw not near, and we shall sit by  the spring, and behold our world in it—sky and house and garden  and ourselves.
-----
On a clear night we shall often wander in our orchard's shade and listen for die loving god in us, while the plant raises its bowed head from its midday sleep, and the still life of your  flowers is refreshed when they bathe their tender arms in the dew  and the night air breathes its penetrating coolness around them, and  above us the meadow of the sky blooms with all its twinkling  flowers, and to one side the moon behind westerly clouds shyly  imitates the setting of the youthful sun as if for love of him—and  then in the morning when our valley is like a riverbed filled with  warm light, and the golden stream runs silently through our trees  and flows around our house and makes the lovely room that is your  handiwork more beautiful for you, and you move through its sunny  brightness and, in your grace, bless the day for me, beloved!
-----
then, as  we thus celebrate the delight of morning, when the busy life of Earth  is kindled before our eyes like a burnt sacrifice and we go forth to  our day's work, to cast our share, too, into the rising flame, will you    1  not say then, 'We are happy, we are again like the ancient priests of  Nature, who, sacred and free, were already pious before ever a  temple stood9?
-----
"Have I said enough?
-----
now decide my fate, dear maid, and soon!—  It is fortunate that I am still half an invalid, as I have been since the  last battle, and that I have not yet been released from service;  otherwise I could not remain here, I could not but go myself, ask you  myself, and that would not be right, for it would be to besiege you.—  "Ah, Diotima!
-----
anxious, foolish thoughts assail my heart, and  yet—I cannot think that this hope, too, will founder.
-----
"Have you perhaps become too great to return now to earthly  happiness?
-----
does the mighty flame of spirit that was kindled at your  sorrow, does it perhaps consume all that is mortal in you?
-----
"I know well that he who lightly quarrels with the world is  reconciled with it even more lightly.
-----
But you, who have the quiet of a  child, you, once so happy in your high humility, Diotima!
-----
who shall  reconcile you when your quarrel is with destiny?
-----
"Dear life!
-----
is there then no more power of healing for you in me?
-----
of all the notes of the heart, does none any longer call you back to  the life of men, where once you lingered so beautifully in descended  flight?
-----
oh, come!
-----
oh, remain in this twilight!
-----
This shadow-land is  surely love's element, only here does the quiet dew erf melancholy  run from the heaven of your eyes.
-----
"And do you no longer remember our golden days, those enchanting, divinely melodious days?
-----
do they not rustle to you from all the groves of Calaurea?
-----
"And see!
-----
so much has perished in me, and I have few hopes left  Your image with its heavenly awareness—that I still have, like a  household god saved from the conflagration.
-----
Our life, ours, is still  inviolate in me.
-----
Should I now arise and bury this too!
-----
Shall I go  forth, with no rest and no goal, from one homelessness to another?
-----
Is it for this that I learned to love?
-----
"No, no!
-----
you my first and my last!
-----
You were mine, and mine you  shall remain."
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  I was sitting with Alabanda on a hill near where we were staying, in  the kindly warmth of the sun, and around us the wind played with    11  fallen leaves.
-----
The countryside was quiet; only here and there, a tree  felled by the farmer crashed far away in the woods and, close by, the  intermittent rain-fed stream murmured down to the peaceful sea.
-----
I was almost carefree; I hoped to see my Diotima soon now, soon  now to live with her in quiet happiness.
-----
Alabanda had talked me out  of all my doubts; he was so certain of it himself.
-----
He, too, was serene,  but in another sense.
-----
The future had no more power over him.
-----
Oh, I  did not know it: he was at the end of his joys; with all his claims on  the world, all his conquering nature, he saw himself useless, ineffectual, and alone, and he accepted it as if he had lost some game played but to while away the time.
-----
A messenger arrived.
-----
He brought us the discharge from military  service for which we had both petitioned the command of the  Russian fleet because there was nothing left for us to do that seemed  worth the effort.
-----
I could now leave Paros whenever I pleased.
-----
And I  was now well enough to travel.
-----
I did not want to wait for Diotima's  answer; I wanted to be off to her, it was as if a god were driving me  to Calaurea.
-----
When Alabanda heard me say this, his color changed  and he looked at me sorrowfully.
-----
"Is it so easy for my Hyperion," he  cried, "to forsake his Alabanda?"
-----
"Forsake?"
-----
I said.
-----
"What do you mean?"
-----
"Oh, you dreamers!"
-----
he cried.
-----
"Do you not see that we must  part?"
-----
"How should I see it?"
-----
I answered; "you have not said a word  about it; and what I have seen in you now and again that seemed to  point to a separation I took in good part as a momentary mood, as  coming from a heart too full—"  "Oh, I know it well," he cried, "that divine game when love in its wealth pretends to be in need, so that it can shower its plenty on  itself, and I would that it were thus with me, good heart!
-----
but in this  case I am in earnest!"
-----
"In earnest?"
-----
I cried.
-----
"But why?"
-----
"Why, my Hyperion," he said gently.
-----
"Because I would not wish  to trouble your future happiness, because I cannot but fear to be  close to Diotima.
-----
Believe me, it is risky to live with lovers, and a  heart with nothing to do, as mine now is, can scarcely bear it."
-----
"Ah, my good Alabanda," I said with a smile, "how little you  know yourself!
-----
You are not such a thing of wax, and your steadfast    3  soul is not so easily carried out of its domain.
-----
For the first time in  your life you give in to groundless fancies.
-----
You played nurse for me  here, and it is plain to see how little your nature is suited to i t Ulis  sitting about doing nothing has made you timorous—"  "There you are!"
-----
he cried, "that is it exactly.
-----
Living with you and Diotima, should I be any more active?
-----
If it were some other woman!
-----
but this Diotima!
-----
can I help it?
-----
can I feel her with half my soul?
-----
she,  who is so utterly at one with herself, one divinely undivided life?
-----
Believe me, it is childishness to undertake to see such a being and  not love her.
-----
You look at me as if you did not know me, do you?
-----
But I  have grown a stranger to myself these last days, since her being has  become so living a presence in me."
-----
"Oh, why cannot I give her to you?"
-----
I cried.
-----
"Enough!"
-----
he said.
-----
"Do not try to console me, for here there is no place for consolation, I am alone, alone, and my life is running out  like an hourglass."
-----
"Great soul!"
-----
I cried, "must it come to this for you?"
-----
"Accept what is!"
-----
he said.
-----
"I was already beginning to wither  when we found each other in Smyrna.
-----
Yes!
-----
in the days when I was  still a ship's boy and my spirit and all my limbs were strong and  swift on coarse food and daring work!
-----
In those days, when in the  clear air after a stormy night I clung to the top of the mast under the  billowing flag and gazed after the seabird over the shining deep,  when in frequent battle our raging ships tore up the sea as the boar's  tusk tears the earth and I stood at my captain's side clear-eyed—in  those days I lived, oh, then I lived!
-----
And long after that, when the  young Tiniote met me on the Smyrnean shore, with his earnestness,  and his love, and my hardened soul was bedewed again by the  youth's gaze and learned to love and to hold sacred all that is too  good to be subdued, when I began a new life with him, and new,  more spiritual powers germinated in me to make me better able to  delight in the world and to struggle with it, then I hoped again—ah!
-----
and all that I hoped and had was inseparably linked with you; I took  you to me, sought to drag you into my destiny by force, lost you,  found you again; our friendship alone was my world, my value, my  fame; now that is over too, forever, and my whole existence is in  vain."
-----
"But is that true?"
-----
I answered, sighing.
-----
11  "True as the sun," he cried, "but let it be!
-----
Everything is provided for."
-----
"What do you mean, my Alabanda?
-----
* said I.
-----
"Let me tell you," he said.
-----
"I have never yet spoken to you fully about a certain matter.
-----
And then—it quiets both you and me a little  when we talk of the past.
-----
"Once long ago, helpless and desperate, I was wandering about  the waterfront of Trieste.
-----
The privateer on which I was serving had  been shipwrecked some years earlier, and I had barelymanaged to  save myself, with a few others, on the shore near Seville.
-----
My captain  was drowned and my life and my dripping garments were all that  remained to me.
-----
I undressed and rested in die sunshine and dried  my clothes on the bushes.
-----
Then I resumed my journey along the  road to the city.
-----
Before I came to the gates, I saw people making  merry in the gardens; I entered and sang a happy Greek song.
-----
I did  not know a sad one.
-----
All the while 1 was hot with the shame and pain  of exhibiting my misfortune in this way.
-----
I was an eighteen-year-old  boy, wild and proud, and I hated like death to be the object of  people's attention.
-----
'Forgive me,91 said, when I had finished my song;  '1 have just escaped from a shipwreck and at present know no better  way to do the world a service than to sing to it.91 had said this in  such Spanish as I could manage.
-----
A man with a fine face came up to  me, gave me money, and, speaking our language, said with a smile:  "There!
-----
buy yourself a grindstone with that and learn to sharpen  knives, and you can resume your travels, but on dry land!9 The  advice pleased me.
-----
"Sir!
-----
I will do just that,91 answered.
-----
All the others  rewarded me liberally too, and I left them and did as the man had  .
-----
advised me, and so wandered for a time through Spain and France.
-----
"What I experienced during that time, how the thousand forms  that servitude assumes intensified my love of freedom and many a  hard hour of need increased my courage to live and sharpened my  wits, 1 have often delighted in telling you.
-----
"I practiced my innocent, wandering trade with pleasure, but  finally it was spoiled for me.
-----
"People took it to be a mask, probably because I did not look  mean enough for such an occupation; they imagined I was covertly  engaged in some dangerous undertaking, and in fact I was twice  arrested.
-----
All this decided me to give it up, and with the little money I  had earned I set out to make my way back to the home from which I    5  had run away* I was soon in Trieste and about to start down through  Dalmatia.
-----
Just then the accumulated hardships of my journey laid  me low with an illness that made my small capital vanish.
-----
Only half  recovered, I was wandering sadly along the waterfront at Trieste.
-----
Suddenly, there stood the man who had once befriended me when I  was cast ashore at Seville.
-----
He was wonderfully glad to see me, told  me that he often thought of me, and asked how things had gone with  me meanwhile.
-----
I told him all.
-----
'I see,9 he cried, 'that it was no bad  thing to send*you to the school of fete for a while.
-----
You have learned  endurance, now you shall go to work whenever you please.'
-----
"The words, his tone, his handclasp, his manner, his look, all  went like some divine force to my inmost being, which much  suffering had now made even more inflammable than before, and I  surrendered.
-----
"The man of whom I speak, Hyperion, was one of those whom  you saw with me in Smyrna.
-----
The very next night he introduced me  to the members of a solemn society.
-----
A shudder ran through me as I  entered the room and my companion, pointing to the earnest group  of men, said: 'This is the League of Nemesis/ Intoxicated by the  immense sphere of action that opened before me, I solemnly made  over my blood and my soul to these men.
-----
Soon afterward the  meeting was adjourned, to be reconvened in some other place years  later, and each set out on the appointed path that he was to follow  through the world.
-----
I'was made an associate of those whom you  found with me some years afterward in Smyrna.
-----
"The constraint under which I lived often tortured me; then too, I  saw little of the great accomplishments of the League and my hunger  for action found little nourishment.
-----
But all this was not enough to  enable me to desert.
-----
My love for you finally led me away.
-----
I have often  told you that I was as if without air and sun when you were absent;  and I had no other choice: I must give up either you or my League.
-----
What I chose, you see.
-----
"But every human act finds its punishment at last; only gods and  children are not smitten by Nemesis.
-----
"I put the divine right of the heart first.
-----
For my dear one's sake I  broke myoath.
-----
Was not that right?
-----
must hot the noblest longing Be  the freest?—My heart took me at my word; I gave it freedom, and  you see it uses it    11  "Once do homage to the Genius and he will heed no mortal  hindrance thereafter, he will tear all the bonds of life in two for you.
-----
"I broke my obligation for my friend's sake; I would break  friendship for the sake of love.
-----
For Diotima's sake I would betray  you, and finally kill Diotima and myself because, even so, we should  not be one.
-----
But it shall stop here; if I must pay for what I did, I will do it freely; I choose my own judge; those whom I failed shall have  me."
-----
a Do you speak of your fellows in the League?"
-----
I cried; "O my  Alabanda!
-----
do it not!"
-----
aWhat can they take from me but my blood?"
-----
he answered.
-----
Then  he gently clasped my hand.
-----
"Hyperion!"
-----
he cried, "my time has run out, and all that remains to me is a noble end.
-----
Leave me!
-----
do not  make me less than I am, have faith in my word!
-----
I know as well as you  do that I could still trump up some kind of existence for myself  could, now that life's meal is eaten, still sit playing with the crumbs;  but that is not for me, nor for you.«Need I say more?
-----
Do I not speak  to you from your own soul?
-----
I thirst for air, for coolness, Hyperion!
-----
My soul seethes over of itself and will no longer be confined to the  old circle.
-----
Soon the beautiful days of winter will be here, when the  dark earth is but the foil to the shining heavens—that would be  the right time, then the isles of light glimmer the more hospitably!—  You are amazed by what I say?
-----
Dearest one!
-----
all who are departing  talk like drunken men and delight to behave as at a feast.
-----
When the  tree begins to wither, do not all its leaves bear the red of morning?"
-----
"Great soul," I cried, "must I bear to pity you?"
-----
I sensed from his exaltation how deeply he was suffering.
-----
I had  never felt such grief in my life.
-----
And yet, O Bellarmin, yet I felt the  greatness of all joys, to hold such a godlike figure in my eyes and  arms.
-----
"Yes!
-----
die," I cried, "die!
-----
Your heart is glorious enough, your life is ripe, like grapes in autumn.
-----
Go, perfected one!
-----
I would go  with you, if there were no Diotima."
-----
"Have I convinced you now?"
-----
answered Alabanda, "are these  your words?
-----
how deep, how full of soul does all become when once  my Hyperion comprehends it!"
-----
"He flatters," I cried, "to wheedle the unconsidered word from me a second time!
-----
good gods!
-----
to wrest  leave from me for his journey to the tribunal of blood!"
-----
7  "I do not flatter," he answered gravely, "I have a right to do what you would prevent, and no common right!
-----
Honor it!"
-----
There was a fire in his eyes that struck me down like a divine  command, and I felt ashamed to say another word in opposition to  him.
-----
"They will not," I thought meanwhile, "they cannot do it It is too senseless to slaughter such a glorious life, like a sacrificial animal,"  and this conviction calmed me.
-----
It was strangely profitable still to hear him the following night,  when each of us had made ready for his separate journey and, just  before daybreak, we had gone out again to be alone together once  more.
-----
"Do you know," he said, among other things, "why I have never  thought anything but lightly of death?
-----
I feel a life in me which no  god created and no mortal begot.
-----
I believe that our existence is from  ourselves and that it is only of our own free pleasure that we are so  intimately connected with all that is."
-----
"I have never heard you say such a thing before," I replied.
-----
"And what," he went on, "what would this world itself be, if it  were not a harmony of free beings?
-----
if from the beginning the living  Hid not work together, of their own free impulse, in one full-voiced life, how wooden would it not be?
-----
how cold?
-----
what a heartless  assemblage of forms?"
-----
"So it would be true here in the highest sense," I answered, "that without freedom all is dead."
-----
"Yes, yes," he cried, "why!
-----
not a blade of grass sprouts up if it has not its own seed of life within it!
-----
And how much more in me!
-----
and  therefore, dear lad, because I feel that I am free in the highest sense,  that I have no beginning, therefore I believe that I shall have no end,  that I am indestructible.
-----
If a potter's hand made me, he may smash  his vessel whenever he pleases.
-----
But what lives must be unbegotten,  must be of divine nature in its seed, raised above all force and all art,  and therefore inviolable, eternal.
-----
"Every man has his mysteries, dear Hyperion!
-----
his more secret  thoughts; these were mine—ever since I have thought.
-----
"What lives is ineradicable, remains free in its deepest form of  servitude, remains one even if you split it to the base, remains    11  unwounded even if you pierce it to the marrow and its being flies  victorious from your hands.—But the morning wind freshens; our  ships are awake.
-----
O my Hyperion!
-----
I have won through; I have had  the strength to pronounce the death sentence on my heart and to  divide you and me, beloved of my life!
-----
be tender to me now!
-----
spare  me your leave-taking!
-----
let us be quick!
-----
come!—"  A chill ran through my every bone, as I heard him begin thus.
-----
"Oh, by your loyalty, Alabanda!"
-----
I cried, prostrate before him,  "must it be, must it be indeed?
-----
You shouted me down unfairly, you  dragged me along in a frenzy.
-----
Brother!
-----
you did not leave me sense  enough even to ask: 'Where are you going?'"
-----
"I may not name the place, dear heart!"
-----
he answered; "yet perhaps we shall see each other once again."
-----
"See each other again?"
-----
I answered; "then I am the richer by one  belief!
-----
and so I shall become richer and richer in belief and in the  end all will be but belief for me."
-----
"Dear one!"
-----
he cried, "let us be still when words do not help!
-----
let us end like men!
-----
You are spoiling these last moments for yourself»"  Meanwhile, we had come to the harbor.
-----
"One thing more!"
-----
he said, when we were beside his ship.
-----
"Greet  your Diotima!
-----
Love each other!
-----
be happy, beautiful souls!"
-----
"O my Alabanda," I cried, "why can I not go in your stead?"
-----
"What you are called to is more beautiful," he answered; "hold to it!
-----
you belong to her, that fair being is henceforth your world—ah!
-----
since there is no happiness without sacrifice, accept me as the  sacrifice, O Bate, and leave the lovers in their joy!—"  His heart began to overpower him, and he tore himself from me  and leaped into the ship, to shorten the parting for himself and for  me.
-----
I felt the moment like a thunderclap, on which night and  deathly silence followed, but in the midst of this annihilation my  soul recovered to hold him back, the dear one who was departing,  and my arms sprang out toward him of themselves.
-----
"Alas!
-----
Alabanda!
-----
Alabanda!"
-----
I cried, and heard a muffled "Farewell" from the ship.
-----
9  Hyperion to Bellarmin  As it happened, the vessel that was to take me to Calaurea delayed  until late in the day on which Alabanda had gone his way in the  morning.
-----
I stayed by the shore and, wearied by the pains of parting, gazed  silently at the sea, hour after hour.
-----
My spirit told over the sorrowful  days of my slowly dying youth and waveringly, like the beautiful  dove, flitted over the time to come.
-----
I wanted to strengthen myself, I  took out my long forgotten lute to sing a Song of Fate that once in  happy, heedless youth I had repeated after my Adamas.
-----
You move up there in the light  On easeful ground, blessed Geniuses!
-----
Bright divine airs  Touch you lightly,  As the player's fingers  Her holy strings.
-----
Outside of Bate, like the sleeping  Babe, the Heavenly Ones breathe;  Chastely guarded  In modest bud,  Ever for them  Hie spirit blooms,  And their blessed eyes  Gaze in still,  Eternal light.
-----
But to us it is given  Nowhere to rest,  Suffering men  Falter and fall  BBncDy from one  Hour to die next,  Like water flung down  from cüff to cliff, ~  Yearlong into uncertainty.
-----
12  So I sang to the strings.
-----
I had scarcely finished when a boat  arrived; in it I immediately recognized my servant, who brought me  a letter from Diotima.
-----
"So you are still on earth?"
-----
she wrote, "and still see the light of day?
-----
I thought I should find you elsewhere, my love!
-----
Sooner than  you afterward wished, I received the letter that you wrote before the  battle at Cheshme, and so for a whole week I lived believing that you  had thrown yourself into the arms of death, before your servant  arrived with the joyful news that you are still alive.
-----
Moreover, I had  heard only a few days after the battle that the ship on which I knew  you to be had blown up with all hands.
-----
"But O sweet voice!
-----
again I heard you, once again the speech of  the beloved touched me like the air of May, and your beautiful,  hopeful joy, the lovely phantom of our future happiness, for a  moment deceived me too.
-----
"Dear dreamer, why must I wake you?
-----
why can I not say, 'Come,  and make them true, the beautiful days that you promised me!'
-----
But  it is too late, Hyperion, it is too late.
-----
Your maiden has withered since  you have been gone; a fire in me has slowly consumed me, and there  is only a little left.
-----
Do not be dismayed!
-----
Everything in Nature  purifies itself, and everywhere the flower of life frees itself more and  more from coarser stuff»  "Dearest Hyperion!
-----
little did you think to hear my swan song this  year.
-----
Continuation  "Almost as soon as you had gone—nay, even in the days of our  parting—it began.
-----
A strength in my spirit that made me afraid, an  inner life before which the life of earth paled and faltered, like night  lights in the red of morning—Shall I say it?
-----
I could have wished to  go to Delphi and build a temple to the God of Inspiration under the  cliffs of ancient Parnassus, and, a new Pythia, fire the indolent  peoples with divine oracles; and my soul knows that my maidenly  mouth would have opened the eyes and unknit the brows of all those  godforsaken dullards, so powerful was the spirit of life in me!
-----
But  my mortal limbs grew wearier and wearier and my tormenting    1  melancholy bore me inexorably down.
-----
Ah!
-----
often in my quiet arbor I  wept over the roses of youth!
-----
they faded and faded, and your  maiden's cheeks were red from tears.
-----
The trees of old were still  there, and the bower of old—there once your Diotima stood, your  child, Hyperion, before your happy eyes, a blossom among the  blossoms, and the powers of Earth and Heaven met peacefully in  her; now she walked a stranger among the buds of May, and her  trusted confidants, the lovely plants, nodded to her as to a friend,  but she could only mourn; yet I passed none of them by; yet, one  after one, I took leave of all die companions of my youth, die groves  and springs and rustling hillocks.
-----
"Ah!
-----
as long as 1 could, I went with sweet effort up to the height  where you lived with Notara, and talked of you with our friend, as  cheerfully as possible, so that he should not write to you of me; but  soon, when her heart grew too loud, the dissembler slipped out into  the garden, and now there I was at the railing, above the cliff from  which I once looked down with you and out into untrammeled  Nature; ah!
-----
where once I stood, held by your hands, guarded round  by your eyes, in the Tirst trembling warmth of love and would fain  have poured my overflowing soul, lüce sacrificial wine, into the abyss  of life, there now I staggered about and bewailed my grief to die  wind, and my gaze flitted like a shy bird and scarcely dared to look  at the beautifulEartfiTfrom which I was to depart  Continuation  "Thus has it befallen your maiden, Hyperion.
-----
Ask not how; seek not  to explain this death to yourself!
-----
He who thinks to fathom such a  fate ends by cursing himself and all things, and yet not a soul is to  blame.
-----
"Am I to tell you that grief for you has killed me?
-----
oh no!
-----
oh no!
-----
it  was welcome to me, that grief, it gave the death that I carried within  me form and grace; 'You die to honor your beloved,' I could tell  myself now.—  "Or did my soul grow overripe in all the enchantments of our love,  and is that why, like a restive youth, it will no longer stay in its  humble home?
-----
speak!
-----
was it my heart's exuberance that divorced me    12  from mortal life?
-----
did my nature, having known your glorious sel£>  become too proud to be content on this mediocre star?
-----
But if you  taught it to fly, why do you not also teach my soul to return to you?
-----
If you kindled the ether-loving fire, why did you not guard it for  me?—Hear me, beloved!
-----
for your fair soul's sake!
-----
do not accuse  yourself of my death!
-----
"Could you hold me back, when your destiny showed you the  same road?
-----
and if, amid the heroic struggle dt your heart, you had preached to me: 'Be satisfied, child!
-----
and adapt yourself to the times!1  would you not have been the most futile of all the futile?
-----
Continuation  "I will tell you exactly what I believe.
-----
Your fire lived in me, your  spirit had passed into me; but that could hardly have harmed me,  and only your destiny made my new life deadly to me* My soul had  grown too strong for me through you, yet through you it would have  grown quiet again* You drew my life away from the Earth, but you  would also have had power to bind me to the Earth; you would have  conjured my soul into your embracing arms as into a magic circle;  äbi one dt your loving looks would have held me fest, one of your loving speeches would have made me a happy, healthy, child again;  but when a unique destiny bore you away to solitude of spirit as  waters are borne to mountain peaks, oh then, when at last I believed  that the storm of battle had burst open your prison and my Hyperion had soared up into his old freedom again, only then was all decided for me, and now must soon end*  "I have used many words, yet the great Roman heroine died silent  when her Brutus and her country were struggling in the'throes of  death* What better could I do in the best of my last days of life?—Yet  still I feel an urgency to say many things* My life was silent; my  death is loquacious* Enough!
-----
Continuation  "I must tell you but one thing more*  u You would have to perish, you would be bound to despair, but    3  the spirit will save you.
-----
No laurel will comfort you and no crown of  myrtle; Olympus will be your comfort, the living, present Olympus  that blooms ever young about all your senses.
-----
The beautiful world is  my Olympus; in it you will live; and with the holy beings of the  world, with the Gods of Nature, with them you will be happy.
-----
"O be you welcome, you good and true!
-----
you deeply missed, you  unrecognized!
-----
children and eldest of all!
-----
Sun and Earth and Ether,  with all living souls that play about you, about whom you play, in  eternal love!
-----
oh, take all-endeavoring mankind, take the fugitives  back into the family of the gods, receive them into the home of  Nature, from which they fled!—  "You know this word, Hyperion!
-----
You began it in me.
-----
You will  fulfill it in yourself, and dien rest.
-----
"I have enough of it to die happily, a Grecian maiden.
-----
"The poor creatures who know nothing but to toil at their petty  labors, who serve only necessity and scorn the Genius and pay you  no honor, childlike life of Nature!
-----
let them fear death.
-----
Their yoke  has become their world; they know nothing better than their servitude; they shrink from the divine freedom that death gives us!
-----
"But not ILI have risen above the piecework that human hands  have made.
-----
I have felt the life of Nature, which is higher than all  thought—if I become a plant, would that be so great a loss?—I shall  be.
-----
How should I be lost from the sphere of life, in which eternal  love, common to all, holds all natures together?
-----
how should I escape  from the union that binds all beings together?
-----
It does not break as  easily as the loose bonds of this age.
-----
It is not like a market day, when  the people run together and make a hubbub and part.
-----
No!
-----
by the  spirit that makes us one, by the divine spirit that is each man's own  and is common to all!
-----
no!
-----
no!
-----
in the union of Nature fidelity is no  dream!
-----
We part only to be more intimately one, more divinely at  peace with all, with each other.
-----
We die that we may live.
-----
"I shall be; I ask not what I shall be.
-----
To be, to live—that is enough,  that is the honor of the gods; and therefore all things that but have  life are equal in the divine world, and in it there are no masters and  servants.
-----
Natures live together, like lovers; they hold all in common,  spirit, joy, and eternal youth.
-----
"The stars have chosen permanence; they float forever in quiet  fullness of life and Jcnow not age.
-----
We represent perfection in mutability; we divide the great harmonies of joy into changing melodies.
-----
12  Like harp players about the thrones of the eldest of all, we live,  ourselves divine, among the quiet Gods of the World; with our  fleeting lovesong we temper the blissful seriousness of the Sun God  and the rest.
-----
"Look up into the world!
-----
Is it not like an advancing triumphal  procession by which Nature celebrates her eternal victory over all  corruption?
-----
and does not life lead death with it to glorification, as  the general once led captive kings with him?
-----
and we, we are the  virgins and the youths, who accompany the majestic procession  with dance and song in changing shapes and tones*  "Now let me be silent.
-----
To say more would be too much.
-----
We shall,  I must believe, meet again.—  "Sorrowing youth!
-----
soon, soon will you be happier.
-----
Your laurel did  not ripen, and your myrtles faded, for you shall be the priest of  divine Nature, and your days of poetry are already germinating.
-----
aOh, could I but see you in your future beauty!
-----
Farewell.
-----
*  At the same time I received a letter from Notara, in which he wrote:  "The day after she wrote to you for the last time, she became very  quiet, spoke a few words more, and then said that she would rather  leave the earth in fire than be buried, and that we should collect her  ashes in an urn and put them in the forest, in the place where you,  dear one!
-----
first met her.
-----
Soon afterward, as it began to grow dark, she  bade us good night, as if she wanted to sleep» and put her arms  around her beautiful head; we heard her breathing until nearly  morning.
-----
As it became perfectly still then and I heard nothing more,  I went in to her and listened.
-----
"O Hyperion!
-----
what else shall I say?
-----
It was over, and our lamenting  wakened her no more.
-----
"It is a terrible mystery that such a life must die, and I will confess  to you that I myself have neither mind nor belief since I saw this  happen.
-----
"But a beautiful death is always better, Hyperion!
-----
than such a  somnolent life as ours now is.
-----
"To brush away flies is our work in the future; and to gnaw on the  things of the world as children gnaw on the hard iris-root—that, in  the end, is our pleasure J o grow old among young peoples seems to  me a delight, but to grow old where all is old seems to me worse  than anything.—    5  "I would advise you, my Hyperion!
-----
not to come here.
-----
I know you.
-----
It would drive you out of your mind.
-----
Then too, you are not safe here.
-----
My dear friend!
-----
dunk of Diotima's mother, think of me, and preserve yourself!
-----
f  "I will confess to you that I shudder when I consider youi^faü^jBut  I believe, too, that the burning summer does not dry up tKe aeep  springs, but only the shallow rain-fed stream.
-----
I have seen you at  moments, Hyperion, when you seemed to me a higher being.
-----
You  are now put to the test, and you must show who you are.
-----
Farewell."
-----
So Notara wrote; and you ask, my Bellarmin!
-----
how it is with me  now, while I tell you of this.
-----
Best of friends!
-----
I am at peace, for I want nothing better than the  gods.
-----
Must not all things suffer?
-----
And the more excellent, the more  deeply!
-----
Does not sacred Nature suffer?
-----
O my Divinity!
-----
that you  could mourn as you are blissful—that was long beyond my understanding.
-----
But the bliss that does not suffer is sleep, and without death there is no life.
-----
Should you be eternally like a child, and sleep  like that which is nothing?
-----
forego victory?
-----
not run through all  perfections?
-----
Yes!
-----
yes!
-----
sorrow is worthy tQ lie at man's heart and to  be your intimate, O Nature!
-----
For it but leads from one bliss to  another, and there is no other companion on the way.—  I wrote to Notara, when I began to revive again, from Sicily, to  which a ship from Paros first brought me:  "I have obeyed you, my dear Notara!
-----
I am already far from my  friends in Calaurea and now wish to send you news; but words are  hard for me, I must confess.
-----
The blessed, among whom Diotima  now is, do not speak much; in my night, in the abyss of the  mourner, there is an end to speech too.
-----
"My Diotima died a beautiful death; in that you are right; and it is  that, too, which awakens me, and gives me back my sod.
-----
"But it is not to the world as it was that I return.
-----
I am a stranger,  like the unburied when they come up from Acheron, and if I were  on my native island, in the gardens of my youth, which my father  bars to me, ah!
-----
even then, even then I should be a stranger on earth,  and no god would join me to the past again.
-----
"Yes!
-----
all is over.
-----
I must only say that to myself again and again,  must bind my soul with it, so that it shall remain quiet and not fire  up in senseless, childish efforts.
-----
"All is over; and even if I could weep, beautiful Divinity, as once    12  you wept for Adonis, my Diotima will not come back to me and die  wordjjf _aiy heart has lost its power, for only the winds hear me.
-----
"God!
-----
that I myself am nothing, and that the meanest workman  can say he has done more than I!
-----
that they are free to solace  themselves, the shallow of.
-----
mind, and smile and: mockingly call me  dreamer, because my deeds did not ripen for me, because my arms  are not free, because the time in which I live is like the.
-----
raging  Procrustes who, capturing men, put them in a child's cradleand, to.
-----
make them fit into that little bed, hacked off their limbs!
-----
"If only it were not too utterly desperate to fling myself among the  crowd of fools and be torn to pieces!
-----
or if only noble blood need not  be ashamed to mix with the blood of serfs!
-----
oh, if there were a  banner, you Gods!
-----
under which my Alabanda might serve, a Thermopylae where I could honorably let it bleed to death, all the lonely love for which I never find a use!
-----
To be sure, it would be better if I  could live, could live, and quiet great woe with great joy in the new  temples, in the newly assembled Agora of our people; yet I speak not  of that, for I but weep my strength wholly away when I think of it all.
-----
"Ah!
-----
Notara!
-----
it is over with me too; I am weary of my own soul  because I reproach it with Diotima's death, and the thoughts of my  youth, which I prized so greatly, mean nothing to me now.
-----
Did they  not poison my Diotima!
-----
"And now tell me, what refuge remains?—Yesterday I went to the  summit of Aetna.
-----
There I remembered the great Sicilian who, weary  of counting the hours, knowing the soul of die World, in his bold joy  in life there flung himself down into the glorious flames, for 'the  cold poet had to warm himself at the fire,9 said someone later, to  mock him.
-----
"O how gladly would I have taken such mockery upon myself!
-----
but one must think more highly of oneself than I do before, thus  unbidden, one can flee to Nature's heart, or whatever else you may  be pleased to call it, for, believe me!
-----
as I am now I have no names for  things and all before me is uncertainty.
-----
"And now, Notara!
-----
tell me what refuge remains?
-----
"In Calaurea's woods?—Yes!
-----
in the green darkness there where  our trees, the faithful witnesses of our love, still stand, where, like  the red of evening, their dying foliage falls on Diotima's urn and  their beautiful crowns, gradually growing old, bend over Diotima's    7  urn, until they, too, fall upon the beloved ashes—there, there, I could  perhaps live as I wished  "But you advise me to stay away, you think that I am not safe in  Calaurea, and it may be so.
-----
"I know very well you will tell me to go to Alabanda.
-----
But listen!
-----
he is destroyed!
-----
even that firm, slender tree is mouldering, too, and  boys will gather up the chips and make themselves a merry fire with  them« He has gone; he has certain good friends who will make  things easy for him, who are peculiarly skilled in helping out anyone  who finds life something of a burden; he has gone to visit them, and  why?
-----
because there is nothing else for him to do, or, if you would  know all, because a passion is eating out his heart, and do you know  for whom?
-----
for Diotima, whom he believes to be still alive and  married to me and happy—poor Alabanda!
-----
now she belongs to us  both!
-----
MHe traveled into the east, and I am taking a ship northwestward,  because chance will have it so«—  "And now farewell to all of you!
-----
all you dear ones who have been  close to my heart, friends of my youth and you my parents, and all  you dear Greeks, you sufferers!
-----
"You airs that nourished me in tender childhood, and you dark  laurel woods and you cliffs by the shore and you majestic waters that  taught my soul to surmise your greatness—and ah!
-----
you monuments  of sorrow, where my melancholy began, you sacred walls with which  the heroic cities girdle themselves, and you ancient gates through  which many a beautiful traveler passed, you temple pillars and you  rubble of the gods!
-----
and you, O Diotima!
-----
and you valleys of my love,  and you brooks that once saw her blessed form, you trees where she  rejoiced, you springtimes in which she lived, lovely with her flowers,  depart.not, depart not from me!
-----
yet if it must be, you sweet memories!
-----
grow dim you too and leave me, for man can change nothing and the light of life comes and departs as it will."
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  So I arrived among the Germans.
-----
I did not demand much and was  prepared to find even less.
-----
I came there humbly, like homeless, blind    12  Oedipus to the gates of Athens, where the sacred grove received him;  and fair souls came to greet him—  How different my experience!
-----
Barbarians from the remotest past, whom industry and science  and even religion have made yet more barbarous, profoundly incapable of any divine emotion, spoiled to the coreTor tfceltelights of the sacred Graces, offensive to every well-conditioned soul  through the whole range from pretense to pettiness, hollow and  tuneless, like the shards of a discarded pot—such, my Bellarmin!
-----
were my comforters«  It is a hard saying, and yet I speak it because it is the truth: I can  think of no people more at odds with themselves than the Germans J  You see artisans/Butno men, thinkers, but no men, priests, but no  men, masters and servants, but no men, minors and adults, but no  men—is this not like a battlefield on which hacked-off hands and  arms and every other member are scattered about, while the life-  blood flows from them to vanish in the sand?
-----
Everyone follows his own trade, you will tell me, and I say the  same.
-----
jQnly, he must follow jt with his whole soul, must not stifle  every power in him that does not precSelyaccord with his official  designation, must not, with this niggardly anxiety, literally and  hypocritically be only what he Is called; Jet him be what he is,  earnestly, lovingly, then a spirit jives in all that he does; and if he is  forced into an occupation in which the spirit may not live, let him  cast it off with scorn and learn to plow!
-----
But your Germans choose  not to go beyond the barest necessities, which is the reason why  there is so much botched work among them and so little that is free,  that gives any genuine pleasure.
-----
Yet that could be overlooked, were  not such men of necessity insensitive to what is beautiful in life, did  not the curse of godforsaken unnature everywhere lie upon such a  people,—  "The virtues of the Ancients were but glittering vices," was once  said by some malicious tongue (I forget whose); and yet their vices  themselves are virtues, for a childlike, beautiful spirit still lived in  them, andof all that they did nothing was done without soul But  the virtues of t&eXjefmäns are glittering vices and nothing more; for  thff jy&Jbut ji&rcedlabor, wrung from the sterile heart in craven feajr, with the toil of slaves, and they impart no comfort to any pure soul    9  that would draw its sustenance from Beauty, that, ah!
-----
made fastidious by the sacred harmony in noble natures, cannot bear the discord that cries out in all the dead order of these men«  I tell you: there is nothing sacred that is not desecrated, is not  debased to a miserable expedient among this people; and what even  among savages is usually preservedjn sacred purity, these all-calculating barbarians pursue as one pursues any trade, and cannot do otherwise jjbr where a human Jbelng is once conditioned to look,  there it serves its ends, seeks its profit, it dreams no more—God  forbid!—Ft remains sedate; and when it makes holiday and when it  loves and when it prays, and even when spring's lovely festival, when  die season of reconciliation for die world dissolves all cares and  conjures innocence into a guilty heart, when, intoxicated by the  sun's warm rays, the slave in his joy forgets his chains, and the  enemies of mankind, softened by the divinely living air, are as  peaceaBTe as children—when the caterpillar itself grows wings and  the bees swarm, even dien the German sticks to his petty tasks and  scarcely deigns to notice the weather!
-----
But you will sit in judgment,, sacred Nature!
-----
For were they but  modest, these people, did they Mit not make themselves a law unto  die better among diem!
-----
did they but revile not what they are not, yet  even that could be condoned in them, did they but not mock the  divine!—  Or is not that divine which you Germans mock and call soulless?
-----
Is not the air that you drink in better than your chatter?
-----
are not the  sun's rays nobler than all of you in your cleverness?
-----
the earth's  springs and the morning dew refresh your forests; can you too do as  much?
-----
ah!
-----
you can kill, but you cannot bring to life, unless it is done  by love, which proceeds not from you, which you did not invent.
-----
You  worry and contrive, that you may escape Bate, and cannot understand it when your childish arts are unavailing; and meanwhile the stars move innocently on above you.
-----
Where she tolerates you, you  degrade and mangle patient Nature, yet she lives on, in eternal  youth, and you cannot drive away her autumn and her spring, you  corrupt not her ether.
-----
Oh, she must indeed be divine, since you are permitted to destroy  and she grows not old and despite you Beauty remains beautiful!—  It is heart-rending, too, to see your poets, your artists, and all    13  those who still honor the Genius, who love and cultivate Beauty.Th^  poor good creatures live in the world like strangers in their own  "'house, they are exactly like long-suffering Ulysses when he sat at his  door disguised as a beggar while the shameless suitors rioted in the  hall and asked "Who sent us this vagabond?"
-----
Their Muse-inspired youths grow up lor the German people full  of love and spirit and hope; see them seven years later, and they are  wandering about like shades, silent and cold, they are like a soil that  the enemy has sown with salt so that it shall never put forth a blade  of grass, and when they speak, alas for him who understands them!
-----
for him who in their raging Titan strength, as in their protean arts,  can see the desperate battle that their beautiful, troubled spirit  wages against the barbarians with whom it is forced to deal!
-----
^Everything on earth is imperfect," is the Germans' old refrain.
-----
If  only someone would once tell these people whom God has forsaken  that everything is so imperfect among them only because they leave  nothing pure uncorrupted, nothing sacred untouched by their  coarse hands, that nothing thrives among them because they do not  respect the root of all thriving, divine Nature, that life with them is  sj:ale_and imrdened with cares and full of cold, silent discord,  because they scorn the Genius, which brings power and nobilityipto  human endeavor, and serenity into suffering, and love and .brotherhood to towns and houses.
-----
And that too is why they are so afraid of death and, for the sake of  their molluscan existence, bear every indignity, for they know  nothing higher than the bungling job that they have made of things.
-----
O Bellarmin, where a people loves Beauty, where it honors the  Genius in its own artists, there a common spirit is astir like the  breath of life, there the shy mind opens, self-conceit melts away, and  all hearts are reverent and great and enthusiasm brings forth heroes.
-----
The home of all men is with such a people and gladly can the  stranger linger there.
-----
But where divine Nature and her artists are so  insulted, ah!
-----
there life's greatest joy is gone, and any other star is  Better than earth.
-----
There men grow ever more sterile, evemnore  empty, who yet were all born beautiful; servility increases and with  its insolence, intoxication grows with troubles and, with luxury,  hunger and dread of starvation; the blessing of each year becomes a  curse, and all gods flee.
-----
1  And woe for the stranger who journeys in love and comes to such  a people and three times woe for him who comes to such a people as  I came, driven by great grief, a beggar as I was a beggar!—  Enough!
-----
you know me, and will take this in good part, Bellarmin!
-----
I spoke in your name too, I spoke for all who are in that country and  who suffer as I suffered there.
-----
Hyperion to Bellarmin  I now wanted to leave Germany.
-----
I looked for nothing more among  these people, I had been sufficiently offended by relentless affronts, I  was unwilling to let my soul bleed to death among such men.
-----
But the heavenly spring detained me; it was the only pleasure that  remained to me, it was indeed my last love, how could I think of  other things and leave the country where spring too was?
-----
Bellarmin!
-----
never had I so fully experienced the old unchanging  decree of Rite that a new bliss rises in the heart when it perseveres  and suffers through the midnight of anguish, and that, like nightingale voices in the dark, the world's song of life first sounds divinely for us in deep affliction.
-----
For I now lived with the blooming trees as  with geniuses, and the clear brooks that flowed under them whispered the care from my breast like divine voices.
-----
And so it befell me everywhere, dear friend!—when I lay in the grass and tender life  grew green around me, when I climbed the warm hill on which the  rose grew wild about the stone path, and when I rowed along the  gay river shore and among all the islands that the river tenderly  protects.
-----
And when on many a morning, as the sick to medicinal springs, I  climbed to the mountain's summit through the sleeping flowers, but  all about me, sated with sweet sleep, the dear birds flew out of the  foliage, reeling in the half-light and craving the day, and the more  active air now carried up the prayers of the valleys, the voices of the  flocks, and the notes of the morning bells, and now the high light,  divinely serene, followed its accustomed path, enchanting the Earth  with immortal life, so that her heart grew warm and all her children  felt their existence again—oh!
-----
like die moon, which still waited in  the sky to share the joy of the day, I stood lonely too above the plains    13  and wept loving tears down to the shores and the shining waters and  for a long time could not turn away my eyes.
-----
Or at evening, when I wandered far into the valley, to the cradle of  the spring, where the dark oak tops rustled around me and Nature  buried me in her peace like one who dies a blessed death, when the  earth was a shadow, and invisible life whispered among the  branches, among the summits, and over the summits hung the still  evening cloud, a shining mountain from which heaven's rays flowed  down to me, like brooks to quench the traveler's thirst—  wO Sun, O you breezes," I cried, "by you alone my heart still lives,  äs among brothers!"
-----
Thus more and more I surrendered myself to blessed Nature^juid  almost too endlessly.
-----
How gladly would I have become a child again  to be nearer to her, how gladly would I have known less and become  like the pure ray of light to be nearer to her!
-----
oh, one moment in her  peace, to feel her beauty, oh, how much more it meant to me than  years full of thought, than all the endeavors of all-endeavoring  mankind!
-----
What I had learned, what I had done in my life, dissolved  like ice, and all the projects of youth died away in me; O you loved  ones far away, you dead and you living, how intimately at one we  were!
-----
Once I sat far in the fields, by a spring, in the shadow of ivy-green  cliffs and overhanging shrubs in flower.
-----
It was the fairest noonday I  have known.
-----
Sweet breezes blew and the land still shone in morning  freshness and the light smiled silently from its native ether.
-----
Hie  laborers had all gone home to eat and rest from their work; my love  was alone with the springtime and in me was an inconceivable  longing.
-----
"Diotima," I cried, "where are you, oh, where are you?"
-----
And it seemed to me that I heard Diotima's voice, the voice that  cheered me in the days of happiness—  "I am with my kindred," she cried, "with your kindred, whom  the erring minds of men know not."
-----
A gentle terror seized me and my thought fell asleep»  "O dear word from holy mouth," I cried when again I awakened,  "dear riddle, do I understand you?"
-----
And once more I looked back into the cold night of men, and  shuddered and wept for joy that I was so blessed, and I uttered    3  words, I think, but they were like the roar of fire when it flies up and  leave die ashes behind—  a O you," so I thought, awith your gods, Nature!
-----
I have dreamed it  out, the dream of human things, and I say, Only you live, and what  they who know no peace have attempted and conceived melts away  from your flame like beads of wax!
-----
aHow long have they done without you?
-----
oh, how long have their  tribe abused you, called you and your gods common, your living  gods, your silent, blissful gods!
-----
"Men fall from you like rotten fruits, oh, let them perish, for thus  they return to your root; so may I, too, O tree of life, that I may grow  green again with you and breathe your crown about me with all  your budding twigs!
-----
peacefully and devoutly, for we are all sprung  from the same golden seed!
-----
"You springs of earth!
-----
you flowers!
-----
and you woods and you eagles  and you brotherly light!
-----
how old and new is our love!—We are free,  we are not narrowly alike in outward semblance; how should the  mode of Life not vary?
-----
yet we love the ether, all of us, and in the  inmost of our inmost selves we are alike.
-----
"We too, we too, are not parted, Diotima, and tears for you  understand it not.
-----
Living tones are we, we sound together in thy  harmony, Nature!
-----
which who can undo?
-----
who can part lovers?—  "O Soul!
-----
Soul!
-----
Beauty of the World!
-----
indestructible, ravishing one!
-----
with your eternal youth!
-----
you are; what, then, is death and all the  woe of men?—Ah!
-----
those strange creatures have spoken many empty  words.
-----
Yet from delight all comes, and all ends in peace.
-----
"Like lovers' quarrels are the dissonances of the world.
-----
Reconciliation is there, even in the midst of strife, and all things that are parted find one another again.
-----
"The arteries separate and return to the heart and all is one  eternal glowing life."
-----
So I thought.
-----
More soon.

-----
Da ich ein Knabe war,  Rettet* ein Gott mich oft  Vom Geschrei und der Ruthe der Menschen,  Da spielt9 ich sicher und gut  Mit den Blumen des Hains,  Und die Lüftchen des Himmels  Spielten mit mir.
-----
Und wie du das Herz  Der Pflanzen erfreust,  Wenn sie entgegen dir  Die zarten Arme streken,  So hast du mein Herz erfreut  Vater Helios!
-----
und, wie Endymion,  War ich dein Leibling,  Heilige Luna!
-----
O all ihr treuen  Freundlichen Götter!
-----
Daß ihr wüßtet,  Wie euch meine Seele geliebt!
-----
Zwar damals rieft ich noch nicht  Euch mit Nahmen, auch ihr  Nanntet mich nie, wie die Menschen sich nennen  Als kennten sie sich.
-----
Doch kannt' ich euch besser,  Als ich je die Menschen gekannt,  Ich verstand die Stille des Aethers  Der Menschen Worte verstand ich nie«  Mich erzog der Wohllaut  Des säuselnden Hains  Und lieben lernt' ich  Unter den Blumen.
-----
Im Arme der Götter wuchs ich groß.

Poems • 137  When I was a boy.
-----
• .
-----
When I was a boy  A god rescued me often  From shouts and whips of men,  It was then that I played  Safely and well with woodland flowers  And the winds of heaven  Played with me.
-----
And as you delight  The hearts of plants,  When to you they extend  Their delicate arms,  So you delighted my heart,  Father Helios, and like Endymion  I was your darling,  Sacred Moon!
-----
0 all you faithful  Friendly gods!
-----
If only you knew  How my soul loved you.
-----
True, in those days I did not  Call you by name, and you  Never called me as men do, as if  They knew one another, with names.
-----
Yet I knew you better  Than I ever knew men,  1 understood air, its stillness,  Never the language of men.
-----
The whispering woodland's  Harmony taught me,  And I learned to love  Among the flowers.
-----
I grew tall in the arms of the gods.

Michael Hamburger  The Root of All Evil  Being at one is god-like and good, but human, too human, the  mania  Which insists there is only die One, one country, one truth and  one way.

Michael Hamburger    14  Mein Eigentum  In seiner Fülle ruhet der Herbsttag nun,  Geläutert ist die Traub und der Hain ist roth  Vom Obst, wenn schon der holden Blüthen  Manche der Erde zum Danke fielen*  Und rings im Felde, wo ich den Pfad hinaus  Den stillen wandle, ist den Zufriedenen  Ihr Gut gereift und viel der frohen  Mühe gewähret der Reichtum ihnen*  Vom Himmel büket zu den Geschäfftigen  Durch ihre Bäume milde das Licht herab,  Die Freude theilend, denn es wuchs durch  Hände der Menschen allein die Frucht nicht*  Und leuchtest du, o Goldnes, auch mir, und wehst  Auch du mir wieder, Lüftchen, als seegnetest  Du eine Freude mir, wie einst, und  Irrst, wie um Glükliche, mir am Busen?
-----
Einst war ichs, doch wie Rosen, vergänglich war  Das fromme Leben, ach!
-----
und es mahnen noch,  Die blühend mir geblieben sind, die  Holden Gestirne zu oft mich dessen*  Beglükt, wer, ruhig liebend ein frommes Weib,  Am eignen Heerd in rühmlicher Heimath lebt,  Es leuchtet über vestem Boden  Schöner dem sicheren Mann sein Himmel*  Denn, wie die Pflanze, wurzelt auf eignem Grund  Sie nicht, verglüht die Seele des Sterblichen,  Der mit dem Tageslichte nur, ein  Armer, auf heiliger Erde wandelt*      Poems • 141  My Possessions  At rest in fulness, calm lies the autumn day,  The mellow grape is clear and the orchard red  With fruit, though many treasured blossoms  Long ago fell to the Earth in tribute.
-----
And all around where now by the quiet path  I cross the field, for satisfied men their crops  Have ripened, and their riches grant them  Hour after hour of rewarding labor.
-----
From heaven through leafy boughs on the busy ones  A light subdued and temperate glances down  To share their pleasure; for not human  Hands by themselves made the cornfield prosper.
-----
And, golden light, for me will you also shine,  And, breeze, once more for me will you waft, as though  To bless a joy, and still around me  Flutter and play, as for happy mortals?
-----
I too was one, but brief as the full-blown rose  My good life passed, and they that alone are left  In flower for me, die constellations,  Often, too often, remind me of it»  Blessed he who calmly loving a gende wife  Can call a worthy homeland and hearth his own;  Above firm ground more brightly to die  Settled, secure man his heaven glitters.
-----
For like the plant that fails to take root within  Its native ground, the soul of that mortal wilts  Who with the daylight only roams, a  Pauper astray on our Earth, the hallowed.

-----
Doch heute laß mich stille den trauten Pfad  Zum Haine gehn, dem golden die Wipfel schmükt  Sein sterbend Laub, und kränzt auch mir die  Stirne, ihr holden Erinnerungen!
-----
Und daß mir auch zu retten mein sterblich Herz,  Wie andern eine bleibende Stätte sei,  Und heimathlos die Seele mir nicht  Über das Leben hinweg sich sehne,  Sei du, Gesang, mein freundlich Asyl!

Poems • 143  Too strongly always, heavenly heights, you pull  Me upward; gales that rage on a sunny day  Bring home to me your clashing powers,  Mutable gods, and they rend, destroy me.
-----
Today, though, let me walk the familiar path  In silence to the copse that is crowned with gold  Of dying leaves; and my brow also  Garland with gold now, dear recollections!
-----
And that my mortal heart nonetheless may last,  A quiet, sure retreat, as are other men's,  And that my soul may not outfly this  Life in its longing, for ever homeless,  You be my gracious refuge now, song, and you,  Joy-giver, now be tended with loving care,  The garden where intently walking  Under the blossoms that do not wither,  I live in safe ingenuousness while outside  With all its waves the changeable, mighty time,  Roars far away, and to my labors  Only the quieter sun contributes.
-----
Above us mortals, heavenly powers, you bless  Each man's possessions, kindly disposed to all;  O bless mine also, lest too soon the  late put an end to my earthly dreaming.

Michael Hamburger    14  Heidelberg  Lange lieb9 ich dich schon, möchte dich, mir zur Lust,  Mutter nennen, und dir schenken ein kunstlos Lied,  Du, der Vaterlandsstädte  Ländlichschönste, so viel ich sah.
-----
Wie der Vogel des Walds über die Gipfel fliegt,  Schwingt sich über den Strom, wo er vorbei dir glänzt,  Leicht und kräftig die Brüke,  Die von Wagen und Menschen tönt.
-----
Wie von Göttern gesandt, fesselt9 ein Zauber einst  Auf die Brüke mich an, da ich vorüber gieng,  Und herein in die Berge  Mir die reizende Ferne schien,  Und der Jüngling, der Strom, fort in die Ebne zog,  Traurigfroh, wie das Herz, wenn es, sich selbst zu schön,  Liebend unterzugehen,  In die Fluthen der Zeit sich wirft.
-----
Quellen hattest du ihm, hattest dem Flüchtigen  Kühle Schatten geschenkt, und die Gestade sahn  All9 ihm nach, und es bebte  Aus den Wellen ihr lieblich Bild.
-----
Aber schwer in das Thal hieng die gigantische,  Schiksaalskundige Burg nieder bis auf den Grund,  Von den Wettern zerrissen;  Doch die ewige Sonne goß  Ihr verjüngendes Licht über das alternde  Riesenbild, und umher grünte lebendiger  Epheu; freundliche Wälder  Rauschten über die Burg herab.
-----
Sträuche blühten herab, bis wo im heitern Thal,  An den Hügel gelehnt, oder dem Ufer hold,  Deine fröhlichen Gassen  Unter duftenden Gärten ruhn.

Poems • 145  Heidelberg  Long have I loved you and for my own delight  Would call you mother, give you an artless song,  You, of all the towns in our country  The loveliest that ever I saw.
-----
As the forest bird crosses the peaks in flight,  Over the river shimmering past you floats  Airy and strong the bridge,  Humming with sounds of traffic and people.
-----
Once, as if it were sent by gods, enchantment  Seized me as I was passing over the bridge  And the distance with its allure  Shone into the mountainscape,  And that strong youth, the river, was rushing on down  To the plain, sorrowing-glad, like the heart that overflows  With beauty and hurls itself,  To die of love, into the floods of time.
-----
You had fed him with streams, the fugitive, given him  Cool shadow, and all the shores looked on  As he followed his way, their image  Sweetly jockeying over the waves.
-----
But into the valley hung heavy the vast  And fete-acquainted fort, by lightnings torn  To the ground it stood on; yet  Eternal sun still poured  Its freshening light across the giant and aging  Thing, and all around was green with ivy,  Living; friendly woodlands ran  Murmurous down across the fort.
-----
Bushes flowered all down the slope to where,  In the vale serene, with hills to prop them, shores  For them to cling to, your small streets  Mid fragrant garden bowers repose.

Aber verblutet ist  Dann das Wünschen und friedlich  Gleich den Seeligen, fremde gehn  Wir umher, ein Gespräch führet uns ab und auf,  Sinnend, zögernd, doch izt mahnt die Vergessenen  Hier die Stelle des Abschieds,  Es erwärmet ein Herz in uns,  Staunend seh' ich dich an, Stimmen und süßen Sang,  Wie aus voriger Zeit hör' ich und Saitenspiel,  Und die Lilie duftet  Golden über dem Bach uns auf.

Later perhaps one day,  Diotima, we'll meet—here, but desire by then  Will have bled away, peaceful  Like the blessed, and like strangers we'll  Walk about, as our talk leads us now here, now there,  Musing, hesitant, but dien the oblivious ones  See die place where they parted,  And a heart newly warms in us,  Wondering I look at you, voices and lovely song  As from distant times, music of strings, I hear  And the lily unfolds her  Fragrance, golden above the brook.

And when from the calm  And constant year harmony sounds in us, should  It ring as if in idle caprice  Some child had dared to touch for fun  The master's consecrated and pure strings?

-----
Was it for this—  To press the spirit into service, burst in upon  The presence of the good, deriding it, heartless  Disavow simplicity itself and make it  Play for a fee like a beast captive?

Until the selfsame spirit, goaded to a rage,  Cries out, remembering its source, and the master  Hurling his hot darts comes  And leaves you flat, a soul extinguished.

Denn selbstvergessen, allzubereit den Wunsch  Der Götter zu erfüllen, ergreift zu gern  Was sterblich ist, wenn offnen Augs auf  Eigenen Pfaden es einmal wandelt,  Ins All zurük die kürzeste Bahn; so stürzt  Der Strom hinab, er suchet die Ruh, es reißt,  Es ziehet wider Willen ihn, von  Klippe zu Kippe den Steuerlosen  Das wunderbare Sehnen dem Abgrund zu;  Das Ungebundne reizet und Volker auch  Ergreifft die Todeslust und kühne  Städte, nachdem sie versucht das Beste,      Poems • 157  Fearless yet, if he must, man stands, and lonely  Before God, simplicity protects him, no  Weapon he needs, nor subterfuge  Till God's being not there helps him.

Christopher Middleton  Voice of die People  Second Version  The voice of God I called you and thought you once,  In holy youth; and still I do not recant!

No less indifferent to our wisdom  Likewise the rivers rush on, but who does  Not love them?
-----
Always too my own heart is moved  When far away I hear those foreknowing ones,  Hie fleeting, by a route not mine but  Surer than mine, and more swift, roar seaward,  For once they travel down their allotted paths  With open eyes, self-oblivious, too ready to  Comply with what die gods have wished them,  Only too gladly will mortal beings  Speed back into the All by die shortest way;  So rivers plunge—not movement, but rest they seek—  Drawn on, pulled down against their will from  Boulder to boulder—abandoned, helmless—  By that mysterious yearning toward the chasm;  Chaotic deeps attract, and whole peoples too  May come to long for death, and valiant  Towns that have striven to do the best thing,    1S  Von Jahr zu Jahr forttreibend das Werk, sie hat  Ein heilig Ende troffen; die Erde grünt  Und stille vor den Sternen liegt, den  Betenden gleich, in den Sand geworfen  Freiwillig überwunden die lange Kunst  Vor jenen Unnachahmbaren da; er selbst,  Der Mensch, mit eigner Hand zerbrach, die  Hohen zu ehren, sien Werk der Künstler.
-----
Doch minder nicht sind jene den Menschen hold,  Sie lieben wieder, so wie geliebt sie sind,  Und hemmen öfters, daß er lang im  Lichte sich freue, die Bahn des Menschen.
-----
Und, nicht des Adlers Jungen allein, sie wirft  Der Vater aus dem Neste, damit sie nicht  Zu lang' ihm bleiben, uns auch treibt mit  Richtigem Stachel hinaus der Herrscher.
-----
Wohl jenen, die zur Ruhe gegangen sind,  Und vor der Zeit gefallen, auch die, auch die  Geopfert, gleich den Erstlingen der  Erndte, sie haben ein Theil gefunden.

Am Xanthos lag, in griechischer Zeit, die Stadt,  Jezt aber, gleich den größeren die dort ruhn  Ist durch ein Schiksaal sie dem heiigen  Lichte des Tages hinweggekommen.
-----
Sie kamen aber nicht in der offnen Schlacht  Durch eigne Hand um.
-----
Furchterlich ist davon,  Was dort geschehn, die wunderbare  Sage von Osten zu uns gelanget.
-----
Es reizte sie die Güte von Brutus.
-----
Denn  Als Feuer ausgegangen, so bot er sich  Zu helfen ihnen, ob er gleich, als Feldherr,  Stand in Belagerung vor den Thoren.

Poems • 159  Year in, year out pursuing their task—these too  A holy end has stricken; the earth grows green,  And there beneath the stars, like mortals  Deep in their prayers, quite still, prostrated  On sand, outgrown, and willingly, lies long art  Flung down before the Matchless; and he himself  The man, the artist with his own two  Hands broke his work for their sake, in homage.
-----
Yet they, the Heavenly, to men remain well-disposed,  As we love them so they will return our love  And lest too briefly he enjoy the  Light, will obstruct a man's course to ruin«  And not the eagle's fledglings alone their sire  Throws out of eyries, knowing that else too long  They'd idle—us the Ruler also  Goads into flight with a prong that's fitting«  Those men I praise who early lay down to rest,  Who fell before their time, and those also, those  Like firstfruits of the harvest offered  Up—they were granted a part, a portion.
-----
By Xanthos once, in Grecian times, there stood  The town, but how, like greater ones resting there,  Because a destiny ordained it  Xanthos is lost to our holy daylight.
-----
But not in open battle, by their own hands  Her people perished.
-----
Dreadful and marvelous  The legend of that town's destruction,  Traveling on from the East, has reached us.
-----
The kindliness of Brutus provoked them.
-----
For  When fire broke out, most nobly he offered them  His help^ although he led those troops which  Stood at their gates to besiege the township.
-----
16  Doch von den Mauren warfen die Diener sie  Die er gesandt.
-----
Lebendiger ward darauf  Das Feuer und sie freuten sich und ihnen  Streitet' entgegen die Hände Brutus  Und alle waren außer sich selbst.
-----
Geschrei  Entstand und Jauchzen.
-----
Drauf in die Flamme warf  Sich Mann und Weib, von Knaben stürzt' auch  Der von dem Dach, in der Väter Schwerdt der.
-----
Nich räthlich ist es, Helden zu trozen.
-----
Längst  Wars aber vorbereitet.
-----
Die ^ter auch  Da sie ergriffen waren, einst, und  Heftig die persischen Feinde drängten,  Entzündeten, ergreiffend des Stromes Rohr,  Daß sie das Freie fänden, die Stadt.
-----
Und Haus  Und Tempel nahm, zum heiigen Aether  Fliegend, und Menschen hinweg die Flamme.
-----
So hatten es die Kinder gehört, und wohl  Sind gut die Sagen, denn ein Gedächtniß sind  Dem Höchsten sie, doch auch bedarf es  Eines, die heiligen auszulegen.
-----
Chiron  Wo bist du, Nachdenkliches!
-----
das immer muß  Zur Seite gehn, zu Zeiten, wo bist du, Licht?

Poems • 161  Yet from the walls they threw all die servants down  Whom he had sent.
-----
Much livelier then at once  The fire flared up, and they rejoiced, and  Brutus extended his arms towards them,  All were beside themselves.
-----
And great crying there,  Great jubilation sounded.
-----
Then into flames  Leapt man and woman; boys came hurtling  Down from the roofs or their fathers stabbed them.
-----
It is not wise to fight against heroes.
-----
But  Events long past prepared it.
-----
Their ancestors  When they were quite encircled once and  Strongly the Persian forces pressed diem,  Took rushes from the rivers and, that their foes  Might find a desert there, set ablaze their town;  And house and temple—breathed to holy  Aether—and riien did the flame carry off there.
-----
So their descendants heard, and no doubt such lore  Is good, because it served to remind us of  The Highest; yet there's also need of  One to interpret these holy legends.
-----
Michael Hamburger  Chiron  Where are you, thought-infusing, which at this time  Must always move beside me, where are you, light?
-----
Indeed the heart's awake, but, wrathful,  Always astonishing Night constricts me.

16  Sonst nemlich folgt9 ich Kräutern des Walds und lauscht9  Ein waiches Wild am Hügel; und nie umsonst«  Nie täuschten, auch nicht einmal deine  Vögel; denn allzubereit fast kamst du,  So Füllen oder Garten dir labend ward,  Rathschlagend, Herzens wegen; wo bist du, Licht?
-----
Das Herz ist wieder wach, doch herzlos  Zieht die gewaltige Nacht mich immer.
-----
Ich war's wohl.
-----
Und von Krokus und Thymian  Und Korn gab mir die Erde den ersten Straus.
-----
Und bei der Sterne Kühle lernt9 ich,  Aber das Nennbare nur.
-----
Und bei mir  Das wilde Feld entzaubernd, das traur'ge, zog  Der Halbgott, Zevs Knecht, ein, der gerade Mann;  Nun siz9 ich still allein, von einer  Stunde zur anderen, und Gestalten  Aus frischer Erd9 und Wolken der Liebe schafft,  Weil Gift ist zwischen uns, mein Gedanke nun;  Und ferne lausch9 ich hin, ob nicht ein  Freundlicher Retter vieleicht mir komme.
-----
Dann hör9 ich oft den Wagen des Donnerers  Am Mittag, wenn er naht, der bekannteste,  Wenn ihm das Haus bebt und der Boden  Reiniget sich, und die Quaal Echo wird.
-----
Den Retter hör9 ich dann in der Nacht, ich hör9  Ihn tödtend, den Befreier, und drunten voll  Von üpp'gem Kraut, als in Gesichten  Schau ich die Erd9, ein gewaltig Feuer;  Die Tage aber wechseln, wenn einer dann  Zusiehet denen, lieblich und bos', ein Schmerz,  Wenn einer zweigestalt ist, und es  Kennet kein einziger nicht das Beste;    Poems • 163  For then I'd look for herbs of the wood, and on  The hillside hear soft game; and never in vain.
-----
And never once your birds deceived me,  Never; but almost too promptly then you  Would come, when foal or garden contented you,  Advising, for the heart's sake; where are you, light?
-----
The heart's awake once more, but, heartless,  Always most powerful Night allures me.
-----
That one was I, it seems.
-----
And of crocus, thyme  And corn then Earth would pick the first bunch for me.
-----
And in the cool of stars I learned, but  Only the nameable.
-----
Disenchanting  That wild, sad open meadow die demigod,  Zeus' servant came, the straight man, to lodge with me;  Now here I sit alone in silence  Hour after hour, and my mind devises  Shapes for itself—since poison divides us now—  Made up of love's new earth and the clouds of love;  And far I strain my hearing lest a  Kindly deliverer perhaps is coming.
-----
Then often I can hear the great Thunderer's voice  At noon when he, the best-known of all, draws near,  When his own house quakes, the foundations,  Shaken, are cleansed and my torment echoes.
-----
The Savior then I hear in the night, I hear  Him kill, the liberator, and down below,  As if in visions, full of luscious  Weeds I see Earth, a tremendous fire;  But days go by, both lovely and bad, when one  Observes their changes, suffering pain because  Of twofold nature, and when none can  Ever be sure what is best and fittest;    16  Das aber ist der Stachel des Gottes; nie  Kann einer lieben göttliches Unrecht sonst.
-----
Einheimisch aber ist der Gott dann  Angesichts da, und die Erd' ist anders.

Poems • 165  But that's the very sting of the god; and else  Divine injustice never could claim men's love.
-----
But native then, at home, die god is  Visibly present, and Earth is different  Day!
-----
Day!
-----
Once more you can breathe, now drink,  You willows of my streams, an illumined sight,  And sure, true footsteps go, and as a  Ruler, with spurs, and located in your  Own orbit you, die planet of day, appear,  And you, O Earth, our cradle of peace, and you,  House of my forbears who unurban  Traveled in clouds with the woodland creatures.

Now take a horse and armour and lastly, boy,  Take up the slender spear!

Poems • 167  Far since gods grew like men, lonely as woodland beasts,  And since, each in its way, song and the princely choir  Brought the Heavenly in person  Bade to earth, so we too, the tongues  Of the people, have liked living men's company,  Where all kinds are conjoined, equal and open to  Everyone, full of joy—for  So our Bather is, Heaven's God,  Who to rich men and poor offers the thinking day,  At the turning of Tune hold us, the sleepy ones,  Upright still with his golden  Leading-strings, as one holds a child.

Im Zorne reinigt aber  Sich der Gefesselte nun, nun eilt er  Der Linkische; der spottet der Schlaken nun,  Und nimmt und bricht und wirft die Zerbrochenen  Zorntrunken, spielend, dort und da zum  Schauenden Ufer und bei des Fremdlings  Besondrer Stimme stehen die Heerden auf,  Es regen sich die Wälder, es hört tief Land  Den Stromgeist fern, und schaudernd regt im  Nabel der Erde der Geist sich wieder.

Menons Klagen um Diotima  laglich geh9 ich heraus, und such9 ein Anderes immer,  Habe längst sie befragt alle die Pfade des Lands;  Droben die kühlenden Höhn, die Schatten alle besuch" ich,  Und die Quellen; hinauf irret der Geist und hinab,  Ruh9 erbittend; so flieht das getroffene Wild in die Wälder,  Wo es um Mittag sonst sicher im Dunkel geruht;  Aber nimmer erquikt sein grünes Lager das Herz ihm,  Jammernd und schlummerlos treibt es der Stachel umher.

Nicht die Wärme des Lichts, und nicht die Kühle der Nacht hilft,      Poems • 169  Nevertheless the music sounds in his heart.

As dien,  When high in the hills he slept, there is a gushing up,  But now the prisoner washes himself  Clean of his bonds, now he hurries,  Gauche, mocking the slag, seizes and breaks  And hurls the splinters now, drunk with wrath,  In play, hither and thither against  The watchful streamback, and the flocks  Rise to their feet at the special voice of the stranger,  Forests thrill, the plain below can hear  The far spirit erf streams and the shuddering  Spirit thrills in earth's navel again.
-----
Spring comes.
-----
And each thing in its fashion  Breaks into flower.

But he is gone, out of it,  He went awry; they are too generous,  The elementals; it is with gods now he speaks.

Christopher Middleton  Menon's Lament for Diotima  Daily I search, now here, now there my wandering takes me  Countless times I have probed every highway and path;  Coolness I seek on those hilltops, all the shades I revisit,  Then the wellsprings again; up my mind roves and down  Begging for rest; so a wounded deer will flee to the forests  Where he used to lie low, safe in the dark towards noon;  Yet his green lair no longer now can refresh him or soothe him,  Crying and sleepless he roams, cruelly pricked by the thorn,  Neither the warmth of the daylight nor the cool darkness of night  helps,    17  Und in Woogen des Stroms taucht es die Wunden umsonst  Und wie ihm vergebens die Erd' ihr fröhliches Heilkraut  Reicht, und das gährende Blut keiner der Zephyre stillt,  So, ihr Lieben!
-----
auch mir, so will es scheinen, und niemand  Kann von der Stirne mir nehmen den traurigen Traum?
-----
2  Ja!
-----
es frommet auch nicht, ihr Todesgötter!
-----
wenn einmal  Ihr ihn haltet, und fest habt den bezwungenen Mann,  Wenn ihr Bösen hinab in die schaurige Nacht ihn genommen,  Dann zu suchen, zu flehn, oder zu zürnen mit euch,  Oder geduldig auch wohl im furchtsamen Banne zu wohnen,  Und mit Lächeln von euch hören das nüchterne Lied.
-----
Soll es seyn, so vergiß dein Heil, und schlummere klanglos!
-----
Aber doch quillt ein Laut hoffend im Busen dir auf,  Immer kannst du noch nicht, o meine Seele!
-----
noch kannst du's  Nicht gewohnen, und träumst mitten im eisernen Schlaf!
-----
Festzeit hab' ich nicht, doch möcht' ich die Loke bekränzen;  Bin ich allein denn nicht?
-----
aber ein Freundliches muß  Fernher nahe mir seyn, und lächeln muß ich und staunen.
-----
Wie so seelig doch auch mitten im Leide mir ist.
-----
3  Licht der Liebe!
-----
scheinest du denn auch Todten, du goldnes!
-----
Bilder aus hellerer Zeit leuchtet ihr mir in die Nacht?
-----
Liebliche Gärten seid, ihr abendröthlichen Berge,  Seid willkommen und ihr, schweigende Pfade des Hains,  Zeugen himmlischen Glüks, und ihr, hochschauende Sterne,  Die mir damals so oft seegnende Blike gegönnt!
-----
Euch, ihr Liebenden auch, ihr schönen Kinder des Maitags,  Stille Rosen und euch, Lilien, nenn9 ich noch oft!
-----
Wohl gehn Frühlinge fort, ein Jahr verdränget das andre,  Wechselnd und streitend, so tost droben vorüber die Zeit  Über sterblichem Haupt, doch nicht vor seeligen Augen,  Und den Liebenden ist anderes Leben geschenkt.
-----
Denn sie alle die Tag9 und Jahre der Sterne, sie waren  Diotima!

um uns innig und ewig vereint;    Poems • 171  In the river's waves too vainly he washes his wounds.
-----
And as vainly to him now Earth offers herbs that might heal them,  Cheer him, and none of the winds quiets his feverish blood,  So, beloved ones, it seems, with me it is too, and can no one  Lift this dead weight from my brow, break the all-saddening  dream?
-----
2  And indeed, gods of death, when once you have utterly caught him  Seized and fettered the man, so that he cringes, subdued,  When you evil ones down into horrible night have conveyed him  Useless it is to implore, then to be angry with you,  Useless even to bear that grim coercion with patience,  Smiling to hear you each day chant him the sobering song.
-----
If you must, then forget your welfare and drowse away tuneless!
-----
Yet in your heart even now, hoping, a sound rises up,  Still, my soul, even now you cling to your habit of music  Will not give in yet, and dream deep in the lead of dull sleep!
-----
Cause I have none to be festive, but long to put on a green garland;  Am I not quite alone?
-----
Yet something kind now must be  Close to me from afar, so that I simile as I wonder  How in the midst of my grief I can feel happy and blessed.
-----
3  Golden light of love, for dead men, for shades, do you shine then?
-----
Radiant visions recalled, even this night, then, you pierce?
-----
Pleasant gardens, and mountains tinged with crimson at sunset,  Welcome I call you, and you, murmurless path of the grove,  Witness to heavenly joy, and stars more loftily gazing,  Who so freely would grant looks that were blessings to me!
-----
And you lovers, you too, the May-day's beautiful children,  Quiet roses, and you, lilies, I often invoke!
-----
Springs, it is true, go by, one year still supplanting the other,  Changing and warring, so Tune over us mortal men's heads  Rushes past up above, but not in the eyes of the blessed ones,  Nor of lovers, to whom different life is vouchsafed.
-----
For all these, all the days and years of the heavenly planets,  Diotima, round us closely, for ever conjoined;    17  4  Aber wir, zufrieden gesellt, wie die liebenden Schwäne,  Wenn sie ruhen am See, oder, auf Wellen gewiegt,  Niedersehn in die Wasser, wo silberne Wolken sich spiegeln,  Und ätherisches Blau unter den Schiffenden wallt,  So auf Erden wandelten wir.
-----
Und drohte der Nord auch,  Er, der Liebenden Feind, klagenbereitend, und fiel  Von den Ästen das Laub, und flog im Winde der Reegen,  Ruhig lächelten wir, fühlten den eigenen Gott  Unter trautem Gespräch; in Einem Seelengesange,  Ganz in Frieden mit uns kindlich und freudig allein.
-----
Aber das Haus its öde mir nun, und sie haben mein Auge  Mir genommen, auch mich hab' ich verloren mit ihr.
-----
Darum irr9 ich umher, und wohl, wie die Schatten, so muß ich  Leben, und sinnlos dünkt lange das Übrige mir.
-----
5  Feiern möcht' ich; aber wofür?
-----
und singen mit Andern,  Aber so einsam fehlt jegliches Göttliche mir.
-----
Diß ist's, diß mein Gebrechen, ich weiß, es lähmet ein Fluch mir  Darum die Sehnen, und wirft, wo ich beginne, mich hin,  Daß ich fühllos size den Tag, und stumm wie die Kinder,  Nur vom Auge mir kalt öfters die Thräne noch schleicht,  Und die Pflanze des Felds, und der Vögel Singen mich trüb macht,  Weil mit Freuden auch sie Boten des Himmlischen sind,  Aber mir in schaudernder Brust die beseelende Sonne,  Kühl und fruchtlos mir dämmert, wie Stralen der Nacht,  Ach!
-----
und nichtig und leer, wie Gefängnißwände, der Himmel  Eine beugende Last über dem Haupte mir hängt!
-----

o Jugend, und bringen Gebete  Dich nicht wieder, dich nie?
-----
führet kein Pfad mich zurük?

Soll es werden auch mir, wie den Götterlosen, die vormals  Glänzenden Auges doch auch saßen an seeligem lisch9,  Aber übersättiget bald, die schwärmenden Gäste,  Nun verstummet, und nun, unter der Lüfte Gesang,    Poems • 173  4  Meanwhile we—like the mated swans in their summer contentment  When by the lake they rest or on the waves, lightly rocked,  Down they look, at die water, and silvery clouds through that mirror  Drift, and ethereal blue flows where the voyagers p a s s -  Moved and dwelled on this earth.
-----
And though die North Wind was  threatening  Hostile to lovers, he, gathering sorrows, and down  Came dead leaves from the boughs, and rain filled the spluttering  storm-gusts  Calmly we smiled, aware, sure of the tutelar god  Present in talk only ours, one song that our two souls were singing,  Wholly at peace with ourselves, childishly, rapdy alone.
-----
Desolate now is my house, and not only her they have taken,  No, but my own two eyes, myself I have lost, losing her.
-----
That is why, astray, like wandering phantoms I live now  Must live, I fear, and the rest long has seemed senseless to me.
-----
5  Celebrate—yes, but what!
-----
And gladly with others I'd sing now,  Yet alone as I am nothing that's godlike rings true,  This, I know, is it, my failing, a curse maims my sinews  Only because of this, making me flag from the start,  So that numb all day long I sit like a child that is moping  Dumb, though at times a tear coldly creeps out of my eyes,  And the flowers of die field, the singing of birds makes me sad now,  Being heralds of heaven, bearers of heavenly joy,  But to me, in my heart's dank vault, now the soul-giving sun dawns  Cool, infertile, in vain, feeble as rays of the night,  Oh, and futile and empty, walls of a prison, the heavens  Press, a smothering load heaped on my head from above!
-----
6  Once, how different it was!
-----
O youth, will no prayer bring you  back, then,  Never again?
-----
And no path ever again lead me back?
-----
Shall it be my fate, as once it was that of the godless,  Bright-eyed to sit for a time feasting at heavenly boards    17  Unter blühender Erd' entschlafen sind, bis dereinst sie  Eines Wunders Gewalt sie, die Versunkenen, zwingt,  Wiederzukehren, und neu auf grünendem Boden zu wandeln.-  Heiliger Othem durchströmt göttlich die lichte Gestalt,  Wenn das Fest sich beseelt, und Fluthen der Liebe sich regen,  Und vom Himmel getränkt, rauscht der lebendige Strom,  Wenn es drunten ertönt, und ihre Schäze die Nacht zollt,  Und aus Bächen herauf glänzt das begrabene Gold.—  7  Aber o du, die schon am Scheidewege mir damals,  Da ich versank vor dir, tröstend ein Schöneres wies,  Du, die Großes zu sehn, und froher die Götter zu singen,  Schweigend, wie sie, mich einst stille begeisternd gelehrt;  Götterkind!
-----
erscheinest du mir, und grüßest, wie einst, mich,  Redest wieder, wie einst, höhere Dinge mir zu?
-----
Siehe!
-----
weinen vor dir, und klagen muß ich, wenn schon noch,  Denkend edlerer Zeit, dessen die Seele sich schämt.
-----
Denn so lange, so lang auf matten Pfaden der Erde  Hab9 ich, deiner gewohnt, dich in der Irre gesucht,  Freudiger Schuzgeist!
-----
aber umsonst, und Jahre zerrannen,  Seit wir ahnend um uns glänzen die Abende sahn.

-----
im Lichte,  Und dein Dulden erhält liebend, o Gütige, dich;  Und nicht einmal bist du allein; Gespielen genug sind,  Wo du blühest und ruhst unter den Rosen des Jahrs;  Und der Vater, er selbst, durch sanftumathmende Musen  Sendet die zärtlichen Wiegengesänge dir zu.
-----
Ja!
-----
noch ist sie es ganz!
-----
noch schwebt vom Haupte zur Sohle,  Stillherwandelnd, wie sonst, mir die Athenerinn vor.

Und wie, freundlicher Geist!
-----
von heitersinnender Stirne  Seegnend und sicher dein Stral unter die Sterblichen fällt;  So bezeugest du mir's, und sagst mir's, daß ich es andern  Wiedersage, denn auch Andere glauben es nicht,  Daß unsterblicher doch, denn Sorg9 und Zürnen, die Freude  Und ein goldener Tag täglich am Ende noch ist    Poems • 175  But to be cloyed with that food, all those fantastical guests now  Fallen silent, and now, deaf to the music of winds,  Under the flowering earth asleep, till a miracle's power shall  Force them one day to return, deep though they lie now, at rest,  Force them to walk anew the soil that is sprouting new verdure-  Holy breath, then, divine, through their bright bodies will flow  While the feast is inspired and love like great flood waters gathers,  Fed by the heavens themselves, on sweeps the river, alive,  When the deep places boom, Night pays her tribute of riches  And from the beds of streams up glitters gold long submerged.—  7  You, though, who even then, already then at the crossroads  When I fell at your feet, comforting showed me the way,  Taught me to see what is great, to sing with a beauty more mellow,  Joy more serene, the gods, silent as gods are yourself,  Child of the gods, will you appear to me, greet me once more now,  Quietly raising me up, speak to me now of those things?
-----
Look, in your presence I weep, lament, though remembering always  Worthier times that are past, deep in my soul I feel shame.
-----
For so very long on weary paths of the earth now,  Still accustomed to you, you I have sought in the wilds,  Tutelar spirit, but all in vain, and whole years have gone by since  Late in the evenings we walked, bathed in that ominous glow.
-----
8  You, only you, your own light, O heroine, keeps in the light still,  And your patience still keeps you both loving and kind;  Nor indeed are you lonely; playmates enough are provided  Where amid roses you bloom, rest with the flowers of the year;  And the Father himself by means of the balm-breathing Muses  Sends you those cradle-songs warm as a southerly breeze.
-----
Yes, she is quite the same!
-----
From her head to her heels the Athenian,  Quiet and poised as before hovers in front of my eyes.

And as blessing and sure your radiance falls upon mortals,  Tender soul, from your brow wrapt in deep thought, yet serene,  So you prove it to me, and tell me, that also to others  Then I may pass it on, others who doubt as I doubt,  That more enduring than care and anger is holy rejoicing  And that golden the day daily still shines in the end.

I will live, then!

Come, it was all like a dream, the wounds in your wings have already  Healed, and restored to youth all your old hopes leap alive.

Knowledge of greatness is much, yet much still remains to be done,  and  One who loved as you loved only to gods can move on.

You conduct us, dien, you solemn ones, Hours of Communion,  Youthful ones, stay with us, holy Presentiments also,  Pious prayers, and you, Inspirations, and all of you kindly  Spirits who like to attend lovers, to be where they are.
-----
Stay with us two until on communal ground, reunited  'Where, when their coming is due, all the blessed souls will return,  Where the eagles are, the planets, the Bather's own heralds,  Where the Muses are still, heroes and lovers began,  There we shall meet again, or here, on a dew-covered island  Where what is ours for once, blooms that a garden conjoins,  All our poems are true and springs remain beautiful longer  And another, a new year of our souls can begin.

Satt gehn heim von Freuden des Tags zu ruhen die Menschen,  Und Gewinn und Verlust wäget ein sinniges Haupt  Wohlzufrieden zu Haus; leer steht von Trauben und Blumen,  Und von Werken der Hand ruht der geschäftige Markt.

People go home to rest, replete with the day and its pleasures,  liiere to weigh up in their heads, pensive, the gain and the loss,  finding the balance good; stripped bare now of grapes and of  flowers,  As of their hand-made goods, quiet the market stalls lie.

Now a breeze rises too and ruffles the crests of the coppice,  Look, and in secret our globe's shadowy image, the moon,  Slowly is rising too; and Night, the fantastical, comes now  Full of stars and, I think, little concerned about us,  Night, the astonishing, there, the stranger to all that is human,  Over the mountain-tops mournful and gleaming draws on.
-----
2  Marvelous is her favor, Night's, the exalted, and no one  Knows what it is or whence comes all she does and bestows.

So she works on the world and works on our souls ever hoping,  Not even wise men can tell what is her purpose, for so  God, the Highest, has willed, who very much loves you, and  therefore  Dearer even than Night reasoning Day is to you.

Nonetheless there are times when clear eyes too love the shadows,  Tasting sleep uncompelled, trying the pleasure it gives,    18  Oder es bükt auch gern ein treuer Mann in die Nacht hin,  Ja, es ziemet sich ihr Kränze zu weihn und Gesang,  Weil den Irrenden sie geheiliget ist und den Todten,  Selber aber besteht, ewig, in freiestem Geist*  Aber sie muß uns auch, daß in der zaudernden Weile,  Daß im Finstern für uns einiges Haltbare sei,  Uns die Vergessenheit und das Heiligtrunkene gönnen,  Gönnen das strömende Wort, das, wie die Liebenden, sei,  Schlummerlos und vollem Pokal und Kühneres Leben,  Heilig Gedächtniß auch, wachend zu bleiben bei Nacht«  3  Auch verbergen umsonst das Herz im Busen, umsonst nur  Halten den Muth noch wir, Meister und Knaben, denn wer  Möcht' es hindern und wer möcht* uns die Freude verbieten?

-----
But to us in her turn, so that in the wavering moment,  Deep in the dark there shall be something at least that endures,  Holy drunkenness she must grant and frenzied oblivion,  Grant the on-rushing word, sleepless as lovers are too,  And a wine-cup more full, a life more intense and more daring,  Holy remembrance too, keeping us wakeful at night*  3  And in vain we conceal our hearts deep within us, in vain we,  Master and novice alike, still keep our courage in check.

For who now would stop us, who would forbid us rejoicing?

Daylong, nightlong we're urged on by a fire that's divine.

Urged to be gone.
-----
Let us go, then!
-----
Off to see open spaces,  Where we may seek what is ours, distant, remote though it bet  One thing is sure even now: at noon or just before midnight,  Whether it's early or late, always a measure exists,  Common to all, though his own to each one is also allotted,  Each of us makes for the place, reaches the place that he can.
-----
Well, then, may jubilant madness laugh at those who deride it,  When in hallowed Night poets are seized by its power;  Off to the Isthmus, then!
-----
To land where wide open the sea roars  Near Parnassus and snow glistens on Delphian rocks;  Off to Olympian regions, up to the heights of Cithaeron,  Up to die pine trees there, up to the grapes, from which rush  Thebe down there and Ismenos, loud in the country of Cadmus:  Thence has come and back there points the god who's to come.

But the thrones, where are they?

Where are the temples, the  vessels,    18  Wo mit Nectar gefüllt, Göttern zu Lust der Gesang?

Wo, wo leuchten sie denn, die fernhintreffenden Sprüche?
-----
Delphi schlummert und wo tönet das große Geschik?

wo brichts, allgegenwärtigen Glüks voll  Donnernd aus heiterer Luft über die Augen herein?

so riefe und flog von Zunge zu Zunge  Tausendfach, es ertrug keiner das Leben allein;  Ausgetheilet erfreut solch Gut und getauschet, mit Fremden,  Wirds ein Jubel, es wächst schlafend des Wortes Gewalt  Vater!

-----
und hallt, so weit es gehet, das uralt  Zeichen, von Eltern geerbt, treffend und schaffend hinab.

Denn so kehren die Himmlischen ein, tiefschütternd gelangt so  Aus den Schatten herab unter die Menschen ihr Tag.
-----
5  Unempfunden kommen sie erst, es streben entgegen  Ihnen die Kinder, zu hell kommet, zu blendend das Glük,  Und es scheut sie der Mensch, kaum weiß zu sagen ein Halbgott,  Wer mit Nahmen sie sind, die mit den Gaaben ihm nahn.
-----
Aber der Muth von ihnen ist groß, es füllen das Herz ihm  Ihre Freuden und kaum weiß er zu brauchen das Gut,  Schafft, verschwendet und fest ward ihm Unheiliges heilig,  Das er mit seegnender Hand thörig und gütig berührt.
-----
Möglichst dulden die Himmlischen diß; dann aber in Wahrheit  Kommen sie selbst und gewohnt werden die Menschen des Glüks  Und des Tags und zu schaun die Offenbaren, das Antliz  Derer, welche, schon längst Eines und Alles genannt,  Tief die verschwiegene Brust mit freier Genüge gefüllet,  Und zuerst und allein alles Verlangen beglükt;  So ist der Mensch; wenn da ist das Gut, und es sorget mit Gaaben  Selber ein Gott für ihn, kennet und sieht er es nicht.

Where is the swift?

And full of joy omnipresent, where does it  Hash upon dazzled eyes, thundering fall from dear skies?
-----
Father Aether!
-----
one cried, and tongue after tongue took it up then,  Thousands, no man could bear life so intense on his own;  Shared, such wealth gives delight and later, when bartered with  strangers,  Turns to rapture; the word gathers new strength when asleep:  lather!
-----
Clear light!
-----
and long resounding it travels, the ancient  Sign handed down, and far, striking, creating, rings out  So do die Heavenly enter, shaking the deepest foundations,  Only so from the gloom down to mankind comes their Day.
-----
5  Unperceived at first they come, and only the children  Surge towards them, too bright, dazzling, this joy enters in,  So that men are afraid, a demigod hardly can tell yet  Who they are, and name those who approach him with gifts.
-----
Yet their courage is great, his heart soon is full of their gladness  And he hardly knows what's to be done with such wealth,  Busily runs and wastes it, almost regarding as sacred  Trash which his blessing hand foolishly, kindly has touched.
-----
This, while they can, the Heavenly bear with; but then they appear  in  Truth, in person, and now men grow accustomed to joy,  And to Day, and the sight of godhead revealed, and their faces—  One and All long ago, once and for all, they were named—  Who with free self-content had deeply suffused silent bosoms,  Brom the first and alone satisfied every desire.
-----
Such is man; when the wealth is there, and no less than a god in  Person tends him with gifts, blind he remains, unaware.
-----
first he must suffer; but now he names his most treasured  possession,  Now for it words like flowers leaping alive he must find.

Nichts darf schauen das Licht, was nicht den Hohen gefallet,  Vor den Aether gebührt müßigversuchendes nicht  Drum in der Gegenwart der Himmlischen würdig zu stehen,  Richten in herrlichen Ordnungen Volker sich auf  Untereinander und baun die schönen Tempel und Städte  Vest und edel, sie gehn über Gestaden empor—  Aber wo sind sie?
-----
wo blühn die Bekannten, die Kronen des Festes?

Hiebe welkt und Athen; rauschen die Waffen nicht mehr  In Olympia, nicht die goldnen Wagen des Kampfepieis,  Und bekränzen sich denn nimmer die Schiffe Korinths?

Warum schweigen auch sie, die alten heiigen Theater?
-----
Warum freuet sich denn nicht der geweihete Tanz?
-----
Warum zeichnet, wie sonst, die Stirne des Mannes ein Gott nicht,  Drükt den Stempel, wie sonst, nicht dem Getroffenen auf?

Oder er kam auch selbst und nahm des Menschen Gestalt an  Und vollendet'und schloß tröstend das himmlische Fest.

-----
wir kommen zu spät.
-----
Zwar leben die Götter,  Aber über dem Haupt droben in anderer Welt  Endlos wirken sie da und scheinens wenig zu achten,  Ob wir leben, so sehr schonen die Himmlischen uns.

Denn nicht immer vermag ein schwaches Gefäß sie zu fassen,  Nur zu Zeiten erträgt göttliche Fülle der Mensch.

Aber das Irrsaal  Hilft, wie Schlummer und stark machet die Noth und die Nacht,  Biß daß Helden genug in der ehernen Wiege gewachsen,  Herzen an Kraft, wie sonst, ähnlich den Himmlischen sind.

Donnernd Kommen sie drauf.

Poems • 18S  6  Now in earnest he means to honor the gods who have blessed  him,  Now in truth and in deed all must re-echo their praise.
-----
Nothing must see the light but what to those high ones is pleasing,  Idle and bungled work never for Aether was fit  So, to be worthy and stand unashamed in the heavenly presence,  Nations rise up and soon, gloriously ordered, compete  One with the other in building beautiful temples and cities,  Noble and firm they tower high above river and sea—  Only, where are they?
-----
Where thrive those famed ones, the festival's  garlands?
-----
Athens is withered, and Thebes; now do no weapons ring out  In Olympia, nor now those chariots, all golden, in games there,  And no longer are wreaths hung on Corinthian ships?
-----
Why are they silent too, the theaters, ancient and hallowed?
-----
Why not now does the dance celebrate, consecrate joy?
-----
Why no more does a god imprint on the brow of a mortal  Struck, as by lightning, the mark, brand him, as once he would  do?
-----
Else he would come himself, assuming a shape that was human,  And, consoling the guests, crowned and concluded the feast.
-----
7  But, my friend, we have come too late.
-----
Though the gods are living,  Over our heads they live, up in a different world.
-----
Endlessly there they act and, such is their kind wish to spare us,  Little they seem to care whether we live or do not.
-----
For not always a frail, a delicate vessel can hold them,  Only at times can our kind bear the full impact of gods.
-----
Ever after our life is dream about them.
-----
But frenzy,  Wandering, helps, like sleep; Night and distress make us strong  Till in that cradle of steel heroes enough have been fostered,  Hearts in strength can match heavenly strength as before.
-----
Thundering then they come.
-----
But meanwhile too often I think it's  Better to sleep than to be friendless as we are, alone,  Always waiting, and what to do or to say in the meantime  I don't know, and who wants poets at all in lean years?
-----
But they are, you say, like those holy ones, priests of the wine-god  Who in holy Night roamed from one place to the next.

18  8  Nemlich, als vor einiger Zeit, uns dünket sie lange,  Aufwärts stiegen sie all, welche das Leben beglükt,  Als der Vater gewandt sein Angesicht von den Menschen,  Und das Trauern mit Recht über der Erde begann,  Als erschienen zu lezt ein stiller Genius, himmlisch  Tröstend, welcher des Tags Ende verkündet9 und schwand,  Ließ zum Zeichen, daß einst er da gewesen und wieder  Käme, der himmlische Chor einige Gaaben zurük,  Derer menschlich, wie sonst, wir uns zu freuen vermöchten,  Denn zur Freude, mit Geist, wurde das Größre zu groß  Unter den Menschen und noch, noch fehlen die Starken zu höchsten  Freuden, aber es lebt stille noch einiger Dank.

sie sagen mit Recht, er söhne den Tag mit der Nacht aus,  Führe des Himmels Gestirn ewig hinunter, hinauf,  Allzeit froh, wie das Laub der immergrünenden Hebte,  Das er liebt, und der Kranz, den er von Epheu gewählt,  Weil er bleibet und selbst die Spur der entflohenen Götter  Götterlosen hinab unter das Finstere bringt.

Aber indessen kommt als Eakelschwinger des Höchsten    Poems • 187  8  For, when some time ago now—to us it seems ages—  Up rose all those by whom life had been brightened, made glad,  When the Bather had turned his face from the sight of us mortals  And all over the earth, rightly, they started to mourn,  Lastly a Genius had come, dispensing heavenly comfort,  He who proclaimed the Day's end, then himself went away,  Then, as a token that once they had been down here and once  more would  Come, the heavenly choir left a few presents behind,  Gifts in which now as ever humanly men might take pleasure,  Since for spiritual joy great things had now grown too great  Here, among men, and even now there's a lack of those strong for  Joy's extremity, but silent some thanks do live on.
-----
Bread is a fruit of Earth, yet touched by the blessing of sunlight,  From the thundering god issues the gladness of wine.
-----
Therefore in tasting them we think of the Heavenly who once were  Here and shall come again, come when their advent is due;  Therefore also the poets in serious hymns to the wine-god,  Never idly devised, sound that most ancient one's praise.
-----
9  Yes, and rightly they say he reconciles Day with our Nighttime,  Leads the stars of the sky upward and down without end,  Always glad, like the living boughs of the evergreen pinetree  Which he loves, and the wreath wound out of ivy for choice  Since it lasts and conveys the trace of the gods now departed  Down to the godless below, into the midst of their gloom.
-----
What of the children of God was foretold in the songs of the  ancients,  Look, we are it, ourselves; fruit of Hesperia it is!

Strictly it has come true, fulfilled as in men by a marvel,  Let those who have seen it believe!

Much, however, occurs,  Nothing succeeds, because we are heartless, mere shadows until  our  lather Aether, made known, recognized, fathers us all.

As on a holiday, to see the field  A countryman goes out, at morning, when  Out of hot night the cooling flashes had Men  For hours on end, and thunder still rumbles afar,  The river enters its banks once more,  New verdure sprouts from the soil,  And with the gladdening rain of heaven  The grapevine drips, and gleaming  In tranquil sunlight stand the trees of the grove:  So now in favorable weather they stand  Whom no mere master teaches, but in  A light embrace, miraculously omnipresent,  Godlike in power and beauty, Nature brings up»  So when she seems to be sleeping at times of die year  Up in the sky or among plants or the peoples,  The poets* faces likewise are sad,  They seem to be alone, but are always divining,  Far divining too she herself is at rest.
-----
But now day breaks!
-----
I waited and saw it come,  And what I saw, the hallowed, my word shall convey,  For she, she herself, who is older than the ages  And higher than the gods of Orient and Occident,  Nature has now awoken amid the clang of arms,  And from high Aether down to the low abyss,  According to fixed law, begotten, as in the past, on holy Chaos,  Delight, the all-creative,  Delights in self-renewal.
-----
And as a fire gleams in the eye of that man  Who has conceived a lofty design,  Once more by the tokens, the deeds erf the world now  A fire has been lit in the souls of the poets.
-----
And that which happened before, but hardly was felt,  Only now is manifest,  And they who smiling worked our fields for us,  Assuming the shape of laborers, now are known,  The all-alive, all-animating powers of the gods.

Denn sind nur reinen Herzens,  Wie Kinder, wir, sind schuldlos unsere Hände,  Des Vaters Stral, der reine versengt es nicht  Und tieferschüttert, die Leiden des Stärkeren  Mitleidend, bleibt in den hochherstürzenden Stürmen  Des Gottes, wenn er nahet, das Herz doch fest.

Und sag ich gleich,    Poems • 195  Do you ask where they are?
-----
In song their spirit wafts  When from the sun erf day and from warm soil  It grows, and storms that are in the air, and others  That, more prepared in the depths erf time,  More full of meaning and more audible to us,  Drift on between Heaven and Earth and amid the peoples.
-----
The thoughts erf the communal spirit they are,  And quietly come to rest in the poet's soul,  So that quickly struck and long familiar  To infinite powers, it shakes  With recollections and kindled by  The holy ray, that fruit conceived in love, the work of gods and  men,  To bear witness to both, the song succeeds.
-----
So once, the poets tell, when $he desired to see  The god in person, visible, did his lightning fall  On Semele's house, and the divinely struck gave birth to  The thunderstorm's fruit, to holy Bacchus.
-----
And hence it is that without danger now  The sons of Earth drink heavenly fire.
-----
Yet, fellow poets, us it behoves to stand  Bare-headed beneath God's thunderstorms,  To grasp the Bather's ray, no less, with our own two hands  And, wrapping in song the heavenly gift,  To offer it to the people.
-----
For if only we are pure in heart,  like children, and our hands are guiltless,  The Bather's ray, the pure, will not sear our hearts  And, deeply convulsed, and sharing his sufferings  Who is stronger than we are, yet in the far-flung down-rushing  storms of  The God, when he draws near, will the heart stand fast.
-----
But, oh, my shame!
-----
when of  My shame!

And let me say at once    19  Ich sei genaht, die Himmlischen zu schauen,  Sie selbst, sie werfen mich tief unter die Lebenden  Den falschen Priester, ins Dunkel, daß ich  Das warnende Lied den Gelehrigen singe.

Dort  Am Quell der Donau  * * *  Denn, wie wenn hoch von der herrlichgestimmten, der Orgel  Im heiligen Saal,  Reinquillend aus den unerschöpflichen Röhren,  Das Vorspiel, wekend, des Morgens beginnt  Und weitumher, von Halle zu Halle,  Der erfrischende nun, der melodische Strom rinnt,  Bis in den kalten Schatten das Haus  Von Begeisterungen erfüllt,  Nun aber erwacht ist, nun, aufsteigend ihr,  Der Sonne des Fests, antwortet  Der Chor der Gemeinde; so kam  Das Wort aus Osten zu uns,  Und an Parnassos Felsen und am Kithäron hör' ich  O Asia, das Echo von dir und es bricht sich  Am Kapitol und jählings herab von den Alpen  Kommt eine Fremdlingin sie  Zu uns, die Erwekerin,  Die menschenbildende Stimme.

Da faßt' ein Staunen die Seele  Der Getroffenen all und Nacht  War über den Augen der Besten.

There  Michael Hamburger  At die Source of the Danube  * * *  For as when high from the gloriously voiced, the organ  Within a holy hall  Untainted welling from inexhaustible pipes,  The prelude, awakening men, rings out in the morning  And far and wide, from mansion to mansion,  Now pours the refreshing, the melodious current,  Down to the chilly shadows even filling  The house with inspirations,  But now awake and rising to it, to  The sun of celebration, responds the  Community's choir—so the word  Came down to us from the East,  And by the rocks of Parnassus and by Cithaeron,  O Asia, I hear the echo of you, and it breaks  Upon the Capitol and sudden down from the Alps  A stranger it comes  To us, that quickening word,  The voice that moulds and makes human.

Amazement then took hold of  The souls of all who were struck, and night  Obscured the eyes of the best men.

19  Denn vieles vermag  Und die Fluth und den Fels und Feuersgewalt auch  Bezwinget mit Kunst der Mensch  Und achtet, der Hochgesinnte, das Schwerdt  Nicht, aber es steht  Vor Göttlichem der Starke neidergeschlagen,  Und gleichet dem Wild fast; das,  Von süßer Jugend getrieben,  Schweift rastlos über die Berg9  Und fühlet die eigene Kraft  In der Mittagshizze.
-----
Wenn aber  Herabgeführt, in spielenden Lüften,  Das heilige Licht, und mit dem kühleren Stral  Der freudige Geist kommt zu  Der seeligen Erde, dann erliegt es, ungewohnt  Des Schönsten und schlummert wachenden Schlaf,  Noch ehe Gestirn naht.

Denn manchen erlosch  Das Augenlicht schon vor den göttlichgesendeten Gaben,  Den freundlichen die aus Ionien uns,  Auch aus Arabia kamen, und froh ward  Der theuern Lehr9 und auch der holden Gesänge  Die Seele jener Entschlafenen nie,  Doch einige wachten.

Und wohlgeschieden, aber darum denken  Wir aneinander doch, ihr Fröhlichen am Isthmos,  Und am Cephyß und am Taygetos,  Auch eurer denken wir, ihr Thale des Kaukasos,  So alt ihr seid, ihr Paradiese dort  Und deiner Patriarchen und deiner Propheten,    Poems • 199  For much can our kind  Accomplish, and flood and rock and even the might of fire  With art can subdue,  Nor, noble in mind, recoils from  The sword blade, but faced with powers divine  The strong will stand abashed  And almost are like the beast of the wilds; which  Impelled by sweet youth  Roams restless over the hills  And feels its own strength in  The noonday heat.

But when,  Led down, in frolicking breezes,  The holy light, and with its cool beam  The joyful spirit descend  To blessed Earth, it succumbs, unfamiliar  With utmost beauty, and drowses in waking sleep,  Though stars are not rising yet* So it is with us* For many's  The man whose vision went out in face of those god-sent gifts,  The kindly, that from Ionia came  To us, from Arabia too, and never  The souls of these now gone to their rest were glad  Of precious doctrine nor yet of the lovely songs,  Yet some kept awake* And often, you citizens  Of beautiful towns, they walked among you contented,  At Games, where once in secret the hero  Invisible sat with poets, watched the wrestlers and smiling  Praised—he, the recipient of praise—those idly serious children*  An endless loving it was, and is*  And rightly severed; yet nonetheless we think  Of one another still, you happy ones at the Isthmus,  And by Cephissus and by Taygetus,  And you we think of, vales of die Caucasus,  However ancient, you paradises there,  And of your patriarchs and of your prophets,    20  O Asia, deiner Starken, o Mutter!

Zwar gehn wir fast, wie die Waisen;  Wohl ists, wie sonst, nur jene Pflege nicht wieder;  Doch Jünglinge, der Kindheit gedenk,  Im Hauße sind auch diese nicht fremde.

True, like orphans almost we walk;  Though much is what it was, that tutelage now is lacking;  But youths who are mindful erf childhood,  These are not strangers now in the house*  Threefold they live, as did  The very first-born of Heaven.
-----
And not for nothing in  Our souls was loyalty fixed.
-----
Not us alone, but that which is yours it preserves  And in those holy relics, the weapons of the word  Which, parting, you sons of Fate,  You left behind for us die less fated,  The less endowed with lightness,  You kindly spirits, in them you are present too,  And often, when die holy cloud is hovering round a man,  We are amazed and do not know the meaning.
-----
But you with nectar spice our breath, and then  We may exult or else a pondering befalls us,  But when too greatly you love a man  He finds no rest till he is one of you.
-----
Therefore, benign ones, surround me lightly,  And let me stay a while, for much remains to be sung;  But now, like a legend of love,  Blissfully weeping, my song  Comes to its end, and so too,  Amid blushing and blanching, it's gone  With me from the start.
-----
But that is how all things go.

Darum ist  Dir angeboren die Treue.

Schwer verläßt,  Was nahe dem Ursprung wohnet, den Ort.

Und deine Kinder, die Städte,  Am weithindämmernden See,  An Nekars Weiden, am Rheine,  Sie alle meinen, es wäre  Sonst nirgend besser zu wohnen.

Auch hat mir ohnediß  In jüngeren Tagen Eines vertraut,  Es seien vor alter Zeit  Die Eltern einst, das deutsche Geschlecht,  Still fortgezogen von Wellen der Donau  Am Sommertage, da diese      Poems • 203  The Migration  Blessed Swabia, my mother,  Traversed by a hundred brooks  Like Lombardy, your more luminous  Sister across the way,  And trees enough, with blossoms white and red,  And darker ones, growing wild, full of deep greens,  And the neighborly Swiss Alps  Provide you with shade; for your dwelling place is near  The hearth, and within you hear  The wellspring purl  From silver cups, pure hands  Pouring the libation, as the sun  Thaws ice-crystals and,  Avalanched  By the quickening light,  Snowcaps drench the earth  With the purest water.
-----
So loyalty  To origin is innate to you.
-----
A place of dwelling  This near the source is hard to leave.
-----
And your offspring, the towns  By shimmering lakes,  By the Neckar's willows, by the Rhine,  All agree there is no  Better spot for home.
-----
Yet I long for the Kaukasos!
-----
Only today I heard  The breezes say  Poets are free as swallows.

And besides, I was told  Long ago that our forefathers,  The German tribe, quietly  Coasted down the Danube  Of a summer's day  And reached the Black Sea,    20  Sich Schatten suchten, zusammen  Mit Kindern der Sonn*  Am schwarzen Meere gekommen;  Und nicht umsonst sei diß  Das gastfreundliche genennet.
-----
Denn, als sie erst sich angesehen,  Da nahten die Anderen erst; dann sazten auch  Die Unseren sich neugierig unter den Ölbaum.
-----
Doch als sich ihre Gewände berührt,  Und keiner vernehmen konnte  Die eigene Rede des andern, wäre wohl  Entstanden ein Zwist, wenn nicht aus Zweigen herunter  Gekommen wäre die Kühlung,  Die Lächeln über das Angesicht  Der Streitenden öfters breitet, und eine Weile  Sahn still sie auf, dann reichten sie sich  Die Hände liebend einander.
-----
Und bald  Vertauschten sie Waffen und all  Die lieben Güter des Haußes,  Vertauschten das Wort auch und es wünschten  Die freundlichen Väter umsonst nichts  Beim Hochzeitjubel den Kindern.

And as they grazed each other's garments  But could not understand  Each other's speech, there would have  Been a fight, had not a cooling  Come down from the boughs  And spread a smile, as it often does,  Across belligerent faces; for a while  They stared in silence, then offered  Their hands in friendship.
-----
And soon  They traded weapons and all  Their precious household goods,  And exchanged the Word, and fathers  Saw that nothing lacked  At their children's wedding feasts.
-----
And from these sacred unions  A race arose, more beautiful than anything  By the name of man  Before or since.
-----
But where can I find you, dear kinsmen,  That we might recelebrate the vows  And honor the memory of our ancestors?
-----
There on the shores beneath the trees  Of Ionia, on the plains of the Cayster,  Where cranes delight in aether,  Bounded by the far-shimmering peaks,  You too were there, O beautiful ones!

By the scarlet cherry tree, or when  The young peaches you sent to me  Are still green in the vineyard,  And the swallow arrives from afar and, bringing endless news,  Builds her house in my walls, in  Maytime, and under stars,  Ionia, I think of you.

Jezt aber, drinn im Gebirg,  Tief unter den silbernen Gipfeln  Und unter fröhlichem Grün,  Wo die Wälder schauernd zu ihm,  Und der Felsen Häupter übereinander  Hinabschaun, taglang, dort  Im kältesten Abgrund hört9  Ich um Erlösung jammern  Den Jüngling, es hörten ihn, wie er tobt*,  Und die Mutter Erd' anklagt9,  Und den Donnerer, der ihn gezeuget,  Erbarmend die Eltern, doch  Die Sterblichen flohn von dem Ort,  Denn furchtbar war, da lichtlos er  In den Fesseln sich wälzte,  Das Rasen des Halbgotts.

Poems • 217  The Rhine  For Isaak von Sinclair  At the forest's gate I sat among  Dark ivy as the golden noon  Came down visiting the stream, from off  The Alps, their mountain staircase, built  By powers divine, God's Castle as  I call it, in accord  With old opinion, where devolves  To man yet many a thing  Decided in secret; thence  Came to my mind, against expectation,  A destiny, for my soul  Telling itself of this and that in the warm shade  Now was drifting toward Italy  And beyond, to die far coasts of Morea.
-----
But now, in the mountains' midst, deep  Down below the silver peaks, and among  Delighting green, where the forests,  Tremulous, and piled crag heads gaze  All day down at him, there  In the coldest abyss I heard  The stripling moan for liberation,  In floundering rage accuse earth,  His mother, and die thunderer who  Begot him, and they heard him also,  His parents, pitying, yet  Mortals fled the place, for it was terrible,  With him in his chained dark torsions,  The frenzy of the demigod    21  Die Stimme wars des edelsten der Ströme,  Des freigeborenen Rheins,  Und anderes hoffte der, als droben von den Brüdern,  Dem Tessin und dem Rhodanus,  Er schied und wandern wollt', und ungeduldig ihn  Nach Asia trieb die königliche Seele.
-----
Doch unverstandig ist  Das Wünschen vor dem Schiksaal.
-----
Die Blindesten aber  Sind Göttersöhne.
-----
Denn es kennet der Mensch  Sein Haus und dem Thier ward, wo  Es bauen solle, doch jenen ist  Der Fehl, daß sie nicht wissen wohin?
-----
In die unerfahrne Seele gegeben.
-----
Ein Räthsel ist Reinentsprungenes.
-----
Auch  Der Gesang kaum darf es enthüllen.
-----
Denn  Wie du anfiengst, wirst du bleiben,  So viel auch wirket die Noth,  Und die Zucht, das meiste nemlich  Vermag die Geburt,  Und der Lichtstral, der  Dem Neugebornen begegnet.
-----
Wo aber ist einer,  Um frei zu bleiben  Sein Leben lang, und des Herzens Wunsch  Allein zu erfüllen, so  Aus günstigen Höhn, wie der Rhein,  Und so aus heiligem Schoose  Glüklich geboren, wie jener?
-----
Drum ist ein Jauchzen sein Wort.
-----
Nicht liebt er, wie andere Kinder,  In Wikelbanden zu weinen;  Denn wo die Ufer zuerst  An die Seit ihm schleichen, die krummen,  Und durstig umwindend ihn,  Den Unbedachten, zu ziehn    Poems • 219  It was die voice of the most noble river,  The freeborn Rhine,  And as he parted up there from his brothers,  Tlcino and Rhodanus, his hopes  Were elsewhere, he meant to travel,  And his royal soul drove him, with impatience,  Toward Asia.
-----
But to desire a thing  In destiny's teeth is not prudent  Yet the blindest of all are  The sons of gods.
-----
For man  Knows his house, where to build  Occurs to the animals, but to their soul  Without experience is given the defect  That they know not where to go.
-----
A riddle it is, whatever  Springs from the pure source.
-----
Even song  May hardly reveal it.
-----
For  As you began so you remain.
-----
And though compulsions leave their mark,  And upbringing, birth performs  The most, and die ray of light encountering  The newborn being.
-----
But where is the man  Who can stay free  As long as he lives, and alone  Accomplish his heart's desire  From heights auspicious as the Rhine's,  And born from a womb as holy  With such fortune as his?
-----
Therefore his speech is a shout of joy.
-----
He does not weep and whine  In swaddling clothes like other infants;  For though die shores at first, crooked,  Sidle up to him and coiling  Thirstily are keen to guide him, unawares,  Twixt their teeth and coddle him there, with a laugh  He rends those snakes to tatters, plunges on,    22  Und wohl zu behüten begehren  Im eigenen Zahne, lachend  Zerreißt er die Schlangen und stürzt  Mit der Beut und wenn in der Eil9  Ein Größerer ihn nich zähmt,  Ihn wachsen läßt, wie der Bliz, muß er  Die Erde spalten, und wie Bezauberte fliehn  Die Wälder ihm nach und zusammensinkend die Berge.
-----
Ein Gott will aber sparen den Söhnen  Das eilende Leben und lächelt,  Wenn unenthaltsam, aber gehemmt  Von heiligen Alpen, ihm  In der Hefe, wie jener, zürnen die Ströme.
-----
In solcher Esse wird dann  Auch alles Lautre geschmiedet,  Und schön ists, wie er drauf,  Nachdem er die Berge verlassen,  Stillwandelnd sich im deutschen Lande  Begnüget und das Sehnen stillt  Im guten Geschaffte, wenn er das Land baut  Der Vater Rhein und liebe Kinder nährt  In Städten, die er gegründet.
-----
Doch nimmer, nimmer vergißt ers.
-----
Denn eher muß die Wohnung vergehn,  Und die Sazung und zum Unbild werden  Der Tag der Menschen, ehe vergessen  Ein solcher dürfte den Ursprung  Und die reine Stimme der Jugend.
-----
Wer war es, der zuerst  Die Liebesbande verderbt  Und Strike von ihnen gemacht hat?
-----
Dann haben des eigenen Rechts  Und gewiß des himmlischen Feuers  Gespottet die Trozigen, dann erst  Die sterblichen Pfade verachtend  Verwegnes erwählt  Und den Göttern gleich zu werden getrachtet.

Poems • 221  Bearing his catch, and if in his haste some  Greater one than he does not tame him,  Nor make him grow, he must split the earth  Like lightning, and die forests hurtle  After him, bewitched, and mountains subsiding.
-----
But a god desires to save his sons  From flitting life, and he smiles  When without restraint, but hemmed in  By holy Alps, the rivers  Rage at him in the depths as this one does.
-----
In such a furnace then  All things freed of dross are shaped  And beauty comes thereafter, when  Leaving the mountains he meanders  Quietly through German lands, content,  And slakes his cravings  In wholesome commerce, in husbandry,  Father Rhine, feeding his beloved  Children in towns that he has founded  Yet never will he forget, never,  For sooner shall man's dwelling perish,  His laws and his light of day become  Monstrous, than such a one  Forget his origin  And the pure voice of his youth.
-----
Who first tainted the ties  Of love and made  Traps of them?
-----
In consequence  Defiant rebels made a mock  Of their own rights and, for sure,  Of heavenly fire, and then  Scorning the ways of mortals  Chose arrogance and ventured  To become the peers of gods.
-----
22  Es haben aber an eigner  Unsterblichkeit die Götter genug, und bedürfen  Die Himmlischen eines Dings,  So sinds Heroen und Menschen  Und Sterbliche sonst.
-----
Denn weil  Die Seeligsten nichts fühlen von selbst,  Muß wohl, wenn solches zu sagen  Erlaubt ist, in der Götter Nahmen  Theilnehmend fühlen ein Andrer,  Den brauchen sie; jedoch ihr Gericht  Ist, daß sein eigenes Haus  Zerbreche der und das Liebste  Wie den Feind schelt' und sich Vater und Kind  Begrabe unter den Trümmern,  Wenn einer, wie sie, seyn will und nicht  Ungleiches dulden, der Schwärmer.
-----
Drum wohl ihm, welcher fand  Ein wohlbeschiedenes Schiksaal,  Wo noch der Wanderungen  Und süß der Leiden Erinnerung  Aufrauscht am sichern Gestade,  Daß da und dorthin gern  Er sehn mag bis an die Grenzen  Die bei der Geburt ihm Gott  Zum Aufenthalte gezeichnet.
-----
Dann ruht er, seeligbescheiden,  Denn alles, was er gewollt,  Das Himmlische, von selber umfingt  Es unbezwungen, lächelnd  Jezt, da er ruhet, den Kühnen.

Wem aber, wie, Rousseau, dir,  Unüberwindlich die Seele    Poems • 223  But the gods have enough  Immortality of their own, and if there be  One thing the celestials need  It is heroes and men  And mortals generally.
-----
For since  The serenest beings feel nothing at all,  There must come, if to speak  Thus is permitted, another who feels  On their behalf, him  They use and need; but their deposition  Is that he shall destroy  His own house, curse what he loves most  As his enemy, and under the rubble  Bury his father and his child,  If he should seek to be like them and not  Allow inequality, the wild dreamer.
-----
Hence fortune is his who found  A right destiny his own,  Where the surge of wayfaring memories  With sweet recall of hardship known  Whispers on a certain shore,  His gaze may thus extend around  To the limits  Drawn at his birth  By God for his dwelling.
-----
Then he shall come to rest, lowly and  Serene, for all his heart desired,  The heaven he wished for, it is there, effortlessly  Surrounding him, the adventurer,  And smiles at him, now that his quiet has come.
-----
Demigods now I'm thinking o£  And must know them, the dears, because  Their lives have so much stirred  My heart, and often.

Yet to a man, Rousseau, like you,  Whose never daunted soul    22  Die starkausdauernde ward,  Und sicherer Sinn  Und süße Gaabe zu hören,  Zu reden so, daß er aus heiliger Fülle  Wie der Weingott, thörig göttlich  Und gesezlos sie die Sprache der Reinesten giebt  Verständlich den Guten, aber mit Recht  Die Achtungslosen mit Blindheit schlägt  Die entweihenden Knechte, wie nenn ich den Fremden?
-----
Die Söhne der Erde sind, wie die Mutter,  Älliebend, so empfangen sie auch  Mühlos, die Glüklichen, Alles.
-----
Drum überraschet es auch  Und schrökt den sterblichen Mann,  Wenn er den Himmel, den  Er mit den liebenden Armen  Sich auf die Schultern gehäufft,  Und die Last der Freude bedenket;  Dann scheint ihm oft das Beste,  Fast ganz vergessen da,  Wo der Stral nicht brennt,  Im Schatten des Walds  Am Bielersee in frischer Grüne zu seyn,  Und sorglosarm an Ionen,  Anfängern gleich, bei Nachtigallen zu lernen.
-----
Und herrlich ists, aus heiligem Schlafe dann  Erstehen und aus Waldes Kühle  Erwachend, Abends nun  Dem milderen Licht entgegenzugehn,  Wenn, der die Berge gebaut  Und den Pfad der Ströme gezeichnet,  Nachdem er lächelnd auch  Der Menschen geschäftiges Leben  Das othemarme, wie Seegel  Mit seinen Lüften gelenkt hat,  Auch ruht und zu der Schülerin jezt,  Der Bildner, Gutes mehr  Denn Böses findend,  Zur heutigen Erde der Tag sich neiget.—    Poems • 225  Persevered, became invincible,  With certitude of mind  And a sweet gift of listening so,  And speaking, that from holy plenitude  like die winegod in his folly divine  And all against the rules he gives it,  The language of essences,  That the good may understand, yet strikes  Blind all who do not care and desecrating  Slaves, how shall I speak of the stranger?
-----
The sons of earth, their love comprehends  All, as does their mother's, whence their luck is,  And no effort, likewise all to receive.
-----
And it comes to mortal man as a surprise,  Startling him, when he thinks  Of die heaven that he, with loving arms,  Heaped on his back,  And of the burden erf joy;  Often it seems then the best thing  To be there, virtually forgotten,  Where the sun's ray does not burn  In the forest shade  By Lake Bienne among fresh green foliage,  And to be learning, with song notes  Happily indigent, like beginners, from nightingales.
-----
And it is glorious to be standing up then  From holy sleep and waking  Out of the forest cool, to walk  Toward the gender light in the evening,  When he who built die mountains  And who designed the courses of streams,  Now done with guiding the short-  Breathed busy lives of men with a smile,  filling them like sails with his winds,  Leans, the artificer, toward his pupil,  finding more good  Than evil, he, the day,  Leaning toward the earth which is today.—    22  Dann feiern das Brautfest Menschen und Götter,  Es feiern die Lebenden all,  Und ausgeglichen  Ist eine Weile das Schiksaal.

Und die Flüchtlinge suchen die Heerberg,  Und süßen Schlummer die Tapfern,  Die Liebenden aber  Sind, was sie waren, sie sind  Zu Hauße, wo die Blume sich freuet  Unschädlicher Gluth und die finsteren Bäume  Der Geist umsäuselt, aber die Unversöhnten  Sind umgewandelt und eilen  Die Hände sich ehe zu reichen,  Bevor das freundliche Licht  Hinuntergeht und die Nacht kommt.

Gott erscheinen oder  In Wolken, du kennst ihn, da du kennest, jugendlich,  Des Guten Kraft, und nimmer ist dir  Verborgen das Lächeln des Herrschers    Poems • 227  Then men and gods their nuptials celebrate,  All living creatures celebrate  And equilibrium for a time  Makes destinies level,  And fugitives seek a resting place,  And sweet slumber is sought by the brave,  But lovers are  Just what they were, they are  At home where the flower enjoys  Innocuous heat and the spirit rustles  Round dark trees, but enemies are  Transformed and rush  To clasp one another's hands  Before the friendly light descending  Vanishes and the night comes.
-----
Yet some there are  This quickly passes by, others  Retain it longer.
-----
At  All times the eternal gods  Are full of life; but into death  Even a man can keep  Stored in memory the best,  And then ultimate experience is his.

For misfortune is hard  To endure, but fortune even harder.

On a fine day—they should consider—almost every mode of  song makes itself heard; and Nature, whence it originates, also  receives it again.

The author intends to offer the public an entire collection of such  pieces, and this one should be regarded as a kind of sample.

With heavenly, quietly echoing,  With calmly modulating music filled,  And aired is the anciently built,  The sweedy familiar hall; upon green carpets wafts  The fragrant cloud of joy and, casting their brightness far,  Full of most mellow fruit and chalices wreathed with gold,  Arranged in seemly order, a splendid row,  Erected here and there on either side above  The leveled floor, stand the tables.

For, come from distant places,  Here, at the evening hour,  Loving guests have forgathered.

23  Und dämmernden Auges denk9 ich schon,  Vom ernsten Tagwerk lächelnd,  Ihn selbst zu sehn, den Fürsten des Fests.

Doch wenn du schon dein Ausland gern verläugnest,  Und als vom langen Heldenzuge müd,  Dein Auge senkst, vergessen, leichtbeschattet,  Und Freundesgestalt annimmst, du Allbekannter, doch  Beugt fast die Knie das Hohe.

Ein Weiser mag mir manches erhellen; wo aber  Ein Gott noch auch erscheint,  Da ist doch andere Klarheit.

Von heute aber nicht, nicht unverkündet ist er;  Und einer, der nicht Fluth noch Flamme gescheuet,  Erstaunet, da es stille worden, umsonst nicht, jezt,  Da Herrschaft nirgend ist zu sehn bei Geistern und Menschen.

Das ist, sie hören das Werk,  Längst vorbereitend, von Morgen nach Abend, jezt erst,  Denn unermeßlich braußt, in der Tiefe verhallend,  Des Donnerers Echo, das tausendjährige Wetter,  Zu schlafen, übertönt von Friedenslauten, hinunter.

Und manchen möcht' ich laden, aber o du,  Der freundlichernst den Menschen zugethan,  Dort unter syrischer Palme,  Wo nahe lag die Stadt, am Brunnen gerne war;  Das Kornfeld rauschte rings, still athmete die Kühlung  Vom Schatten des geweiheten Gebirges,  Und die lieben Freunde, das treue Gewölk,  Umschatteten dich auch, damit der heiligkühne  Durch Wildniß mild dein Stral zu Menschen kam, o Jüngling!

Poems • 231  And already with eyes dusk-dim,  With solemn day-labor smiling,  I think that I see him in person, the prince of the feast day.

But though you like to disavow your foreign land,  And weary, it seems, with long heroic war,  Cast down your eyes, oblivious, lightly shaded,  Assuming the shape of a friend, you known to all men, yet  Almost it bends our knees, such loftiness.
-----
Nothing in  Your presence I know; but one thing: mortal you are not.
-----
A wise man could elucidate much for me; but where  A God as well appears,  A different clarity shines.
-----
Yet not sprung up today, nor unproclaimed he comes;  And one who did not balk at either flood or flame  Not without reason astonishes us, now that all is quiet,  Dominion nowhere to be seen among spirits or mortals.
-----
That is, only now do they hear  The work that long has prepared them, from Orient to Occident,  For now immeasurably, fading away in the deeps,  The Thunderer's echo, the millennial storm  Rolls down to sleep, intermingled with peaceful music.
-----
But you, grown dear to us, O days of innocence,  It's you, beloved, that bring this feast-day too, and round us  The spirit flowers, vespertine in this quiet;  And, friends, I must advise you, though  Our hair had turned silver-grey,  To see to garlands and banquet, now like men immortally young.
-----
And many there are I would invite, but you,  O you that benignly, gravely disposed to men  Down there beneath the Syrian palm tree, where  The town lay near, by the well were glad to be;  Round you the cornfield rustled, quiedy coolness breathed  From shadows of the hallowed mountainsides,  And your dear friends, the faithful cloud  Cast shade upon you too, so that the holy, the bold,  The beam through wilderness gendy should fall on men, O youth.

23  Ach!
-----
aber dunkler umschattete, mitten im Wort, dich  Hirchtbarentscheidend ein tödtlich Verhängniß.
-----
So ist schnell  Vergänglich alles Himmlische; aber umsonst nicht;  Denn schonend rührt des Maases allzeit kundig  Nur einen Augenblik die Wohnungen der Menschen  Ein Gott an, unversehn, und keiner weiß es, wenn?
-----
Auch darf alsdann das Freche drüber gehn,  Und kommen muß zum heiigen Ort das Wilde  Von Enden fern, übt rauhbetastend den Wahn,  Und trift daran ein Schiksaal, aber Dank,  Nie folgt der gleich hernach dem gottgegebnen Geschenke;  Tiefprüfend ist es zu fassen.
-----
Auch war' uns, sparte der Gebende nicht  Schon längst vom Seegen des Heerds  Uns Gipfel und Boden entzündet.
-----
Des Göttlichen aber empfiengen wir  Doch viel.
-----
Es ward die Flamm* uns  In die Hände gegeben, und Ufer und Meersfluth.

Viel mehr, denn menschlicher Weise  Sind jene mit uns, die fremden Kräfte, vertrauet.

Und es lehret Gestirn dich, das  Vor Augen dir ist, doch nimmer kannst du ihm gleichen.

Vom Alllebendigen aber, von dem  Viel Freuden sind und Gesänge,  Ist einer ein Sohn, ein Ruhigmächtiger ist er,  Und nun erkennen wir ihn,  Nun, da wir kennen den Vater  Und Feiertage zu halten  Der hohe, der Geist  Der Welt sich zu Menschen geneigt hat.

Denn längst war der zum Herrn der Zeit zu groß  Und weit aus reichte sein Feld, wann hats ihn aber erschöpfet?

Schiksaalgesez ist diß, daß Alle sich erfahren,    Poems • 233  But oh, more darkly, even as you spoke,  And dreadfully determining a deadly doom overshadowed you  there.

So all  That's heavenly fleets on; but not for nothing;  For sparingly, at all times knowing the measure,  A God for a moment only will touch the dwellings  Of men, by none foreseen, and no one knows when.
-----
And over it then all insolence may pass,  And to the holy place must come die savage  Brom ends remote, and roughly fingering works out his  Delusion, so fulfilling a fate, but thanks  Will never follow at once upon die god-sent gift;  Probed deeply, this can be grasped.

And were not the giver sparing  The wealth of our hearth long ago would  Have fired both the roof and the floor.

Yet much that's divine nonetheless we  Received.

Much more than humanly only  Are these, the alien powers, familiar with us.

And you are taught by the stars  In front of your eyes, but never you can be like them.

Yet to the All-Living from whom  Many joys and songs have sprung  There's one who is a son, and quietly powerful is he,  And now we recognize him,  Now that we know the Father  And to keep holidays  The exalted, the Spirit of  The World has inclined towards men.

For long now he had been too great to rule  As Lord of Tune, and wide his field extended, but when did it  exhaust him?

For once, however, even a God may choose  Mere daily tasks, like mortals, and share all manner of fate.

Wo aber wirkt der Geist, sind wir auch mit, und streiten,  Was wohl das Beste sei.

So dünkt mir jezt das Beste,  Wenn nun vollendet sein Bild und fertig ist der Meister,  Und selbst verklärt davon aus seiner Werkstatt tritt,  Der stille Gott der Zeit und nur der Liebe Gesez,  Das schönausgleichende gilt von hier an bis zum Himmel.
-----
Viel hat von Morgen an,  Seit ein Gespräch wir sind und hören voneinander,  Erfahren der Mensch; bald sind wir aber Gesang.
-----
Und das Zeitbild, das der große Geist entfaltet,  Ein Zeichen liegts vor uns, daß zwischen ihm und andern  Ein Bündniß zwischen ihm und andern Mächten ist.
-----
Nicht er allein, die Unerzeugten, Ew'gen  Sind kennbar alle daran, gleichwie auch an den Pflanzen  Die Mutter Erde sich und Licht und Luft sich kennet.

Zulezt ist aber doch, ihr heiligen Mächte, für euch  Das Liebeszeichen, das Zeugniß  Daß ihrs noch seiet, der Festtag,  Der Allversammelnde, wo Himmlische nicht  Im Wunder offenbar, noch ungesehn im Wetter,  Wo aber bei Gesang gastfreundlich untereinander  In Chören gegenwärtig, eine heilige Zahl  Die Seeligen in jeglicher Weise  Beisammen sind, und ihr Geliebtestes auch,  An dem sie hängen, nicht fehlt; denn darum rief ich  Zum Gastmahl, das bereitet ist,  Dich, Unvergeßlicher, dich, zum Abend der Zeit,  O Jüngling, dich zum Fürsten des Festes; und eher legt  Sich schlafen unser Geschlecht nicht,  Bis ihr Verheißenen all,  All ihr Unsterblichen, uns  Von eurem Himmel zu sagen,  Da seid in unserem Hauße.

Poems • 23S  That when the silence returns there shall be a language too.

So now it seems best to me  If now the Master completes his image and, finished,  Himself transfigured by it, steps out of his workshop,  The quiet God of Tune, and only the law of love,  That gently resolves all difference, prevails from here up to Heaven.
-----
Much, from the morning onwards,  Since we have been a discourse and have heard from one another,  Has human kind learnt; but soon we shall be song.
-----
That temporal image too, which the great Spirit reveals,  As a token lies before us that between him and others,  Himself and other powers, there is a pact of peace.
-----
Not he alone, the Unconceived, Eternal  Can all be known by this, as likewise by the plants  Our Mother Earth and light and air are known.
-----
Yet ultimately, you holy powers, our token  Of love for you, and the proof  That still you are holy to us, is the feast day.
-----
The all-assembling, where heavenly beings are  Not manifest in miracles, nor unseen in thunderstorms,  But where in hymns hospitably conjoined  And present in choirs, a holy number,  The bless&d in every way  Meet and forgather, and their best-beloved,  To whom they are attached, is not missing; for that is why  You to the banquet now prepared I called,  The unforgettable, you, at the Evening of lime,  O youth, called you to the prince of the feast day; nor shall  Our nation ever lie down to sleep until  All you that were prophesied,  Every one of you Immortals,  To tell us about your Heaven  Are here with us in our house.

23  Leichtathmende Lüfte  Verkünden euch schon,  Euch kündet das rauchende Thal  Und der Boden, der vom Wetter noch dröhnet,  Doch Hoffnung röthet die Wangen,  Und vor der Thüre des Haußes  Sizt Mutter und Kind,  Und schauet den Frieden  Und wenige scheinen zu sterben  Es hält ein Ahnen die Seele,  Vom goldnen Lichte gesendet,  Hält ein Versprechen die Ältesten auf.

Wohl sind die Würze des Lebens,  Von oben bereitet und auch  Hinausgeführet, die Mühen.

Wie die Löwin, hast du geklagt,  O Mutter, da du sie,  Natur, die Kinder verloren.
-----
Denn es stahl sie, Allzuliebende, dir  Dein Feind, da du ihn fast  Wie die eigenen Söhne genommen,  Und Satyren die Götter gesellt hast.
-----
So hast du manches gebaut,  Und manches begraben,  Denn es haßt dich, was  Du, vor der Zeit  Allkräftige, zum Lichte gezogen.
-----
Nun kennest, nun lasset du diß;  Denn gerne fühllos ruht,  Bis daß es reift, furchtsamgeschäfftiges drunten.

Poems • 237  Winds lightly breathing  Already announce you,  The vapor that drifts from the valley  And the ground still resounding with thunder,  But hope now flushes our cheeks,  In front of the door of their house  Sit mother and child,  And look upon peace,  And few now seem to be dying;  The souls of the oldest even  Held back by a hint, a promise  Conveyed by the golden light.

Bor now all things are pleasing  But most of all the  Ingenuous, because the long-sought,  The golden fruit,  In shattering gales fallen down from  An age-old bough  But then, as the dearest possession, by Fate herself  Protected with tender weapons,  The shape of the Heavenly it is.
-----
Like the lioness you lamented,  O Mother, when you lost  Your children, Nature,  For they were stolen from you, the all too loving, by  Your enemy, when almost  Like your own sons you had nursed him  And with satyrs made gods consort.
-----
So there is much you built  And much you buried,  Bor you are hated by  That which too soon  All-powerful, you raised to the light.

Now you know the fault, and desist;  Bor, tUl grown ripe, unfeeling  What's timidly busy likes to rest down below.

Poems • 239  The Only One  First Version  What is it that  Binds me to these ancient  Blessed shores, that I love  Them more than my country?
-----
As if sold into  Heavenly bondage,  I am where Apollo  Walked in the guise of a king  And Zeus descended  On innocent youths  And sired sons and daughters  Among mortals by holy means.
-----
Many lofty thoughts  Have sprung from  The Bather's brow,  From him great souls  Have come to men.
-----
I have heard  Of Elis and Olympia, have  Stood atop Parnassos  And above the mountains of the Isthmos  And over toward  Smyrna and down  By Ephesos have I walked;  I have seen much beauty  And sung the image of God  Which lives among men,  And yet, O ancient gods  O brave sons of gods,  There is One among you  Whom I love and seek,  The last of your race,  The jewel of your house  Whom you hide from me,  A passing stranger*    24  Mein Meister und Herr!
-----
O du, mein Lehrer!
-----
Was bist du ferne  Geblieben?

und da  Ich fragte unter den Alten,  Die Helden und  Die Götter, warum bliebest  Du aus?

Es hindert aber eine Schaam  Mich dir zu vergleichen  Die weltlichen Männer.

Poems • 241  My Master and Lord,  My Teacher,  Why have you kept  So far away?
-----
When I  Inquired among the ancients,  Among heroes and  Gods, why did you fail  To appear?
-----
And now  My soul is filled with grief,  As if, O gods, you jealously decreed  That serving the one, I  Thereby lose the other.
-----
But I know, the fault  Is all mind.
-----
For I cling  Too close to you, Christ,  Though you are Heracles' brother  And, I must confess, the brother  Of Euios too, who  Harnassed tigers to his  Chariot and, commanding  Joyous worship down  To the Indus,  Founded vineyards and  Tamed the wrath of nations.
-----
Yet some sense of shame  Keeps me from comparing  Worldly men to you.
-----
And of course  I know who sired you, your Bather,  The very one who  For he never reigns alone.

Wo aber Gefahr ist, wächst  Das Rettende auch.
-----
Im Rnstern wohnen  Die Adler und furchtlos gehn  Die Söhne der Alpen über den Abgrund weg  Auf leichtgebaueten Brüken.
-----
Drum, da gehäuft sind rings  Die Gipfel der Zeit, und die Liebsten  Nah wohnen, ermattend auf  Getrenntesten Bergen,  So gieb unschuldig Wasser,  O Rttige gieb uns, treuesten Sinns  Hinüberzugehn und wiederzukehren.
-----
So sprach ich, da entführte  Mich schneller, denn ich vermuthet  Und weit, wohin ich nimmer  Zu kommen gedacht, ein Genius mich  Vom eigenen Hauß\ Es dämmerten  Im Zwielicht, da ich gieng  Der schattige Wald  Und die sehnsüchtigen Bäche  Der Heimath; nimmer kannt' ich die Länder;  Doch bald, in frischem Glänze,  Geheimnißvoll  Im goldenen Rauche, blühte  Schnellaufgewachsen,  Mit Schritten der Sonne,  Mit tausend Gipfeln duftend,  Mir Asia auf, und geblendet sucht9  Ich eines, das ich kennete, denn ungewohnt  War ich der breiten Gassen, wo herab      Poems • 245  Fatmos  For the Landgrave of Homburg  Near is  And difficult to grasp, the God.
-----
But where danger threatens  That which saves from it also grows.
-----
In gloomy places dwell  The eagles, and fearless over  The chasm walk the sons of the Alps  On bridges lightly built.
-----
Therefore, since round about  Are heaped the summits of Tune  And the most loved live near, growing faint  On mountains most separate,  Give us innocent water,  0 pinions give us, with minds most faithful  To cross over and to return.
-----
So I spoke, when more swiftly  Than ever I had expected,  And far as I never thought  1 should come, a Genius carried me  From my own house.
-----
There glimmered  In twilight, as I went,  The shadowy wood  And the yearning streams of  My homeland; no longer I knew those regions;  But soon, in a radiance fresh,  Mysteriously,  In the golden haze,  Quickly grown up,  With strides of the sun,  And fragrant with a thousand peaks,  Now Asia burst into flower for me, and dazzled  I looked for one thing there I might know, being unaccustomed  To those wide streets where down    24  Vom Tmolus fährt  Der goldgeschmükte Pactol  Und Taurus stehet und Messogis,  Und voll von Blumen der Garten,  Ein stilles Feuer; aber im Lichte  Blüht hoch der silberne Schnee;  Und Zeug unsterblichen Lebens  An unzugangbaren Wänden  Uralt der Epheu wächst und getragen sind  Von lebenden Säulen, Cedern und Lorbeern  Die feierlichen,  Die göttlichgebauten Falläste.
-----
Es rauschen aber um Asias Thore  Hinziehend da und dort  In Ungewisser Meeresebene  Der schattenlosen Straßen genug,  Doch kennt die Inseln der Schifter.
-----
Und da ich hörte  Der nahegelegenen eine  Sei Patmos,  Verlangte mich sehr,  Dort einzukehren und dort  Der dunkeln Grotte zu nahn.
-----
Denn nicht, wie Cypros,  Die quellenreiche, oder  Der anderen eine  Wohnt herrlich Patmos,  Gastfreundlich aber ist  Im ärmeren Hauße  Sie dennoch  Und wenn vom Schiffbruch oder klagend  Um die Heimath oder  Den abgeschiedenen Freund  Ihr nahet einer  Der Fremden, hört sie es gern, und ihre Kinder  Die Stimmen des heißen Hains,    Poems • 247  Brom Tmolus drives  The golden-bedded Factolus,  And Taurus stands, and Messogis,  And full of flowers the garden,  A quiet fire; but in the light, high up  There blossoms the silver snow;  And, witness to life immortal,  On inaccessible walls  Pristine the ivy grows, and supported  On living pillars, cedars and laurels,  There stand the festive,  The palaces built by gods.
-----
But around Asia's gates there murmur,  Extending this way and that  In the uncertain plain of the sea,  Shadowless roads enough;  Yet the boatman knows the islands.
-----
And when I heard  That of the near islands one  Was Fatmos,  I greatly desired  There to be lodged, and there  To approach the dark grotto.
-----
For not like Cyprus,  The rich in weUsprings,  Nor any of the others  Magnificently does Fatmos dwell,  Hospitable nonetheless  In her poorer house  She is,  And when, after shipwreck or lamenting for  His homeland or else for  The friend departed from him,  A stranger draws near  To her, she is glad to hear it, and her children,  The voices of die hot noonday copse,    24  Und wo der Sand fällt, und sich spaltet  Des Feldes Fläche, die Laute  Sie hören ihn und liebend tönt  Es wieder von den Klagen des Manns.
-----
So pflegte  Sie einst des gottgeliebten,  Des Sehers, der in seeliger Jugend war  Gegangen mit  Dem Sohne des Höchsten, unzertrennlich, denn  Es liebte der Gewittertragende die Einfalt  Des Jüngers und es sähe der achtsame Mann  Das Angesicht des Gottes genau,  Da, beim Geheimnisse des Weinstoks, sie  Zusammensaßen, zu der Stunde des Gastmals,  Und in der großen Seele, ruhigahnend den Tod  Aussprach der Herr und die lezte Liebe, denn nie genug  Hatt' er von Güte zu sagen  Der Worte, damals, und zu erheitern, da  Ers sähe, das Zürnen der Welt.
-----
Denn alles ist gut.
-----
Drauf starb er.
-----
Vieles wäre  Zu sagen davon.
-----
Und es sahn ihn, wie er siegend blikte  Den Freudigsten die Freunde noch zulezt,  Doch trauerten sie, da nun  Es Abend worden, erstaunt,  Denn Großentschiedenes hatten in der Seele  Die Männer, aber sie liebten unter der Sonne  Das Leben und lassen wollten sie nicht  Vom Angesichte des Herrn  Und der Heimath.
-----
Eingetrieben war,  Wie Feuer im Eisen, das, und ihnen gieng  Zur Seite der Schatte des Lieben.
-----
Drum sandt' er ihnen  Den Geist, und freilich bebte  Das Haus und die Wetter Gottes rollten  Ferndonnernd über  Die ahnenden Häupter, da, schwersinnend  Versammelt waren die Todeshelden,    Poems • 249  And where the sand falls, and the field's  Flat surface cracks, the sounds—  These hear him, and lovingly all is loud  With the man's re-echoed lament.
-----
So once  She tended the God-beloved,  The seer who in blessdd youth  Had walked with  The son of the Highest, inseparable, for  The bearer of thunder loved the disciple's  Ingenuousness, and the attentive man  Saw the face of the God exactly  When over the mystery of the vine  They sat together at the hour of the communal meal  And in his great soul, calmly foreknowing,  The Lord pronounced death and the ultimate love, for never  He could find words enough  To say about kindness, then, and to soothe, when  He saw it, the wrath of the world.
-----
For all things are good.
-----
After that he died.
-----
Much could  Be said of it.
-----
And the friends at the very last  Saw him, the gladdest, looking up triumphant,  Yet they were sad, now that  The evening had come, amazed,  For the souls of these men contained  Things greatly predetermined, but under the sun they loved  This life and were loath to part from  The visible face of the Lord  And their homeland.
-----
Driven in,  Like fire into iron, was this, and beside them  The loved one's shadow walked.
-----
Therefore he sent them  The Spirit, and mightily trembled  The house, and God's thunderstorms rolled  Distantly rumbling above  Their heads foreknowledge bowed, when deep in thought  Assembled were the heroes of death,    25  Izt, da er scheidend  Noch einmal ihnen erschien.
-----
Denn izt erlosch der Sonne Tag  Der Königliche und zerbrach  Den geradestralenden,  Den Zepter, göttlichleidend, von selbst,  Denn wiederkommen sollt es  Zu rechter Zeit.
-----
Nicht war es gut  Gewesen, später, und schroffabbrechend, untreu,  Der Menschen Werk, und Freude war es  Von nun an,  Zu wohnen in liebender Nacht, und bewahren  In einfältigen Augen, unverwandt  Abgründe der Weisheit.
-----
Und es grünen  Tief an den Bergen auch lebendige Bilder,  Doch furchtbar ist, wie da und dort  Unendlich hin zerstreut das Lebende Gott.
-----
Denn schon das Angesicht  Der theuern Freunde zu lassen  Und fernhin über die Berge zu gehn  Allein, wo zweifach  Erkannt, einstimmig  War himmlischer Geist; und nicht geweissagt war es, sondern  Die Loken ergriff es, gegenwärtig,  Wenn ihnen plözlich  Ferneilend zurük blikte  Der Gott und schwörend,  Damit er halte, wie an Seilen golden  Gebunden hinfort  Das Böse nennend, sie die Hände sich reichten—  Wenn aber stirbt alsdenn  An dem am meisten  Die Schönheit hieng, daß an der Gestalt  Ein Wunder war und die Himmlischen gedeutet  Auf ihn, und wenn, ein Räthsel ewig füreinander  Sie sich nicht fassen können    Poems • 251  Now that, departing,  Once more he appeared to them.
-----
For now the kingly one extinguished  The day erf the sun and broke  The straighdy beaming, the scepter,  Divinely suffering, yet erf his own free will,  For it was to come back when  The time was due.
-----
To have done so later  Would not have been good, and the work of men  Abruptly broken off, disloyally, and from now on  A joy it was  To dwell in loving Night and in fixed,  Ingenuous eyes to preserve  Abysses of wisdom.
-----
And low down at  The foot of mountains, too, will living images thrive,  Yet dreadful it is how here and there  Unendingly God disperses whatever lives.
-----
For only to part from the sight  Of their dear friends  And far across the mountains to go  Alone, when doubly  Perceived, heavenly spirit before had been  Unanimous; and not predicted was this,  But seized them by the hair, on the instant,  When suddenly the God  Ear off in haste looked back  At them, and vowing,  So that he-would stay, from now on goldenly  Bound fast as to ropes,  Calling the evil by name, they linked hands—  But when thereupon he dies  To whom beauty most adhered, so that  A miracle was wrought in his person and  The Heavenly had pointed at him,  And when, an enigma to one another  For ever, they cannot understand    25  Einander, die zusammenlebten  Im Gedächtniß, und nicht den Sand nur oder  Die Weiden es hinwegnimmt und die Tempel  Ergreifft, wenn die Ehre  Des Halbgotts und der Seinen  Verweht und selber sein Angesicht  Der Höchste wendet  Darob, daß nirgend ein  Unsterbliches mehr am Himmel zu sehn ist oder  Auf grüner Erde, was ist diß?

-----
Zwar Eisen traget der Schacht,  Und glühende Harze der Aetna,  So hätt' ich Reichtum,  Ein Bild zu bilden, und ähnlich  Zu schaun, wie er gewesen, den Christ,  Wenn aber einer spornte sich selbst,  Und traurig redend, unterweges, da ich wehrlos wäre  Mich überfiele, daß ich staunt9 und von dem Gotte  Das Bild nachahmen möcht9 ein Knecht—  Im Zorne sichtbar sah9 ich einmal  Des Himmels Herrn, nicht, daß ich seyn sollt etwas, sondern  Zu lernen.

The husk falls at his feet, but  The grain reaches its end,  And there's no harm if some of it  Is lost, and of the speech  The living sound dies away,  Bor the work of gods, too, is like our own,  Not all things at once does the Highest intend.
-----
The pit bears iron, though,  And glowing resins Etna,  And so I should have wealth  With which to form an image and see  The Christ as he truly was,  But if someone spurred himself on  And, talking sadly, on the road, when I was  Defenseless, attacked me, so that amazed I tried  To copy the God's own image, I, a servant—  In anger visible once I saw  The Lord of Heaven, not that I should be something, but  To learn.

For when extinguished is fame, the delight in seeing, and no longer  maintained  By human kind, shadowless, the paths succumb to doubt, and the  trees,  And kingdoms, the youthful land of eyes, are perished,  More athletic  In ruin, and inborn innocence  Is torn to shreds.

For from God unalloyed  Does conscience come and go, revelation, the hand of the Lord  Richly beckons from judging Heaven, then and for a time there  Is indivisible law, and office, and hands to  Be raised, both this and to control  The falling of evil thoughts, loose.

Es sah aber der achtsame Mann  Das Angesicht des Gottes,  Damals, da, beim Geheimnisse des Weinstoks sie  Zusammensaßen, zu der Stunde des Gastmals,  Und in der großen Seele, wohlauswählend, den Tod  Aussprach der Herr, und die lezte Liebe, denn nie genug  Hatt er, von Güte, zu sagen  Der Worte, damals, und zu bejahn bejahendes.

Aber sein Licht war  Tod.

But the attentive man saw  The face of God,  At that time, when over the mystery erf the vine  They sat together, at the hour erf the communal meal,  And in his great soul, carefully choosing, the Lord  Pronounced death, and the ultimate love, for never  He could find words enough  To say about kindness, then, and to affirm the affirmative.
-----
But his  light was  Death.
-----
For niggardly is the wrath of the world.
-----
Yet this he recognized.

All is good.
-----
Thereupon he died.

But nevertheless, bowed down, the friends at the very last  Before God saw the denier's presence, as when  A century bends, thoughtfully, in  The joy of truth,  Yet they were sad, now that  The evening had come.

But those men were loath  To part from the face of the Lord  And from their homeland.

But go now and greet  The lovely Garonne  And the gardens of Bordeaux,  There, where the path cuts  Along the shore and the stream dives  Riverward, but a noble pair  Of oaks and white poplars  Looks on from above;  All this still comes to mind and how  The broad tops of elms  Bend over die mill,  But a figtree is growing in the courtyard.

There are those  Who shy from the source;  Since riches begin  At sea.

Like  Painters, they gather  The beauty of the earth, nor refuse  Wings of war or years lived  Alone beneath a mast  Without leaves, where the night is not  Brightened by the feast days of the city,  Nor by lyre or native dances.
-----
But now the men are gone  To the Indies,  From that breezy spit of land  And hillsides of grapes, where  The Dordogne descends  Toward the majestic Garonne  And the two flow out  As one wide sea.

But memory  Is taken and given by the ocean,  And the eyes of love do not waver in their gaze,  But poets establish what remains.

So wundert  Mich nicht, daß er  Den Herkules zu Gaste geladen,  Fernglänzend, am Olympos drunten,  Da der, sich Schatten zu suchen  Vom heißen Isthmos kam,  Denn voll des Muthes waren  Daselbst sie, es bedarf aber, der Geister wegen,  Der Kühlung auch.
-----
Darum zog jener lieber  An die Wasserquellen hieher und gelben Ufer,  Hoch duftend oben, und schwarz  Vom Fichtenwald, wo in den Tiefen  Ein Jäger gern lustwandelt  Mittags, und Wachstum hörbar ist  An harzigen Bäumen des Isters,    Poems • 269  But, as for us, we sing from the Indus,  Arrived from afar, and  from the Alpheus, long we  Have sought what is fitting,  Not without wings may one  Reach out for that which is nearest  Directly  And get to the other side.

But here we wish to build.
-----
For rivers make arable  The land.
-----
For when herbs are growing  And to the same in summer  The animals go to drink,  There too will human kind go.
-----
This one, however, is called the Ister.
-----
Beautifully he dwells.
-----
The pillars* foliage burns,  And stirs.
-----
Wildly they stand  Supporting one another; above,  A second measure, juts out  The roof of rocks.
-----
No wonder, therefore,  I say, this river  Invited Hercules,  Distantly gleaming, down by Olympus,  When he, to look for shadows,  Came up from the sultry isthmus,  For full of courage they were  In that place, but, because of the spirits,  There's need of coolness too.
-----
That is why that hero  Preferred to come here to the wellsprings and yellow banks,  Highly fragrant on top, and black  With fir woods, in whose depths  A huntsman loves to amble  At noon, and growth is audible  In resinous trees of the Ister,    27  Der scheinet aber fast  Rükwärts zu gehen und  Ich mein, er müsse kommen  Von Osten.

Vieles wäre  Zu sagen davon.

Und warum hängt er  An den Bergen gerad?

Ein Zeichen braucht es  Nichts anderes, schlecht und recht, damit es Sonn  Und Mond trag9 im Gemüth', untrennbar,  Und fortgeh, Tag und Nacht auch, und  Die Himmlischen warm sich fühlen aneinander.

Darum sind jene auch  Die Freude des Höchsten.

Denn wie kam er  Herunter?
-----
Und wie Hertha grün,  Sind sie die Kinder des Himmels.
-----
Aber allzugedultig  Scheint der mir, nicht  Freier, und fast zu spotten.

Much could  Be said about this.

And why does  It cling to the mountains, straight?
-----
The other,  The Rhine, has gone away  Sideways.
-----
Not for nothing rivers flow  Through dry land.
-----
But how?
-----
A sign is needed,  Nothing else, plain and honest, so that  Sun and moon it may bear in mind, inseparable,  And go away, day and night no less, and  The Heavenly feel warm one beside the other.
-----
That also is why these are  The joy of the Highest.
-----
Bor how  Would he get down?
-----
And like Hertha green  They are the children of Heaven.
-----
But all too patient  He seems to me, not  More free, and nearly derisive.
-----
For when  Day is due to begin  In youth, where it starts  To grow, another already there  Drives high the splendour, and like foals  He grinds the bit, and far off the breezes  Can hear die commotion,  If he is contented;  But the rock needs incisions  And the earth needs furrows,  Would be desolate else, unabiding;  Yet what that one does, the river,  Nobody knows.

Poems • 273  Mnemosyne  A sign we are, without meaning  Without pain we are and have nearly  Lost our language in foreign lands,  For when the heavens quarrel  Over humans and moons proceed  In force, the sea  Speaks out and rivers must find  Their way.

But there is One,  Without doubt, who  Can change this any day.
-----
He needs  No law.

Tlie rusde of leaf and then the sway of oaks  Beside glaciers.

Not everything  Is in die power of die gods.

Mortals would sooner  Reach toward die abyss.
-----
With them  The echo turns.

Though the time  Be long, truth  Will come to pass.
-----
But what we love?
-----
We see sunshine  On the floor and motes of dust  And the shadows of our native woods and smoke  Blooms from rooftops, at peace beside  Turrets* ancient crowns; for the signs  Of day are good if a god has scarred  The soul in response.
-----
Snow, like lilies of the valley,  Signifying a site  Of nobility, half gleams  With the green of the Alpine meadow  Where, talking of a wayside cross  Commemorating die dead,  A traveler climbs in a rage,  Sharing distant premonitions with  The other, but what is this?

-----
And many  Others also died.

Hyperion has often been compared with Goethe's Sufferings of Young  Werther and, though the two works exhibit a number of similar formal aspects and thematic preoccupations, the reader will find a more complex  emplotment of die dialectic of desire, so central to both novels, in the work  of the younger poetTTn the preface to the "Fragment of Hyperion," the  shape of this dialectic is characterized as the "eccentric path" leading man from a condition of "more or less pure simplicity" to one of "more or less completed cultivation."
-----
In the preface to the final version, the eccentric path is described as the movement toward the "resolution of dissonances in a  particular character."
-----
In the novel this movement takes place at two levels: that of die life story told by the "hermit in Greece" and that of die narration itselt That is, in Hyperion the eccentric path signifies not only the lived life of joys and sorrows, communion and conflict, in the realms of politics and  287    288 • Endnotes  Eros, but the work of narration itselt For the author of these letters, the elegiac procedures of anamnesis and narration prove to be as important and  transformative as any other life experience.

1797-98 (dates given for composition of poems are in large measure  conjectural).
-----
Holderlin's mythology of childhood seems to have been largely  influenced by Rousseau.
-----
This mythology is familiar from Hyperion: MThe  child is wholly what it is, and that is why it is so beautiful.
-----
The pressure of  Law and Fate touches it not; only in the child is freedom.
-----
In die child is  peace; it has not yet come to be at odds with itself."
-----
"Empedokles"  1798.
-----
The fifth-century B.C.
-----
poet-philosopher was the subject of Hölderlin's  unfinished tragedy, "The Death of Empedocles?
-----
which occupied him from  1797 to 1799.
-----
Empedoclesfe suicide was for Hölderlin a powerful reminder  of the dangers of the longing for unmediated contact with the sacred  element.
-----
The "queen" is an allusion to Cleopatra, who, according to  Plinius, melted pearls in vinegar and drank them to win a bet with Anthony  that she could consume ten million sestertia at one meal.
-----
"SophoUes"  Probably written in the summer of 1799 while working on plans for his ill-  fated literary journal Iduna.
-----
The epigram expresses the deep affinity be-  tween tragedy, sacrifice, and elegy in Hölderlin's writings.
-----
In his notes to  Antigone, Hölderlin writes: "The tragic representation has as its premise  .

the merging of the fully present God with m a n .

such that the infinite enthusiasm gathers itself infinitely, that i s , .

in a consciousness that  cancels itself as consciousness,... and the God becomes manifest in the  figure of death."
-----
"The Root of All Evil" / "Wurzel alles Übels"  1799.
-----
In the poem Hölderlin distances himself from the totalitarian poten-  tial in philosophies and politics that overemphasize identity at the expense    Endnotes • 289  of heterogeneity.
-----
Hyperion remarks to Alabanda: "The state has always  been made a hell by man's wanting to make it his heaven."
-----
"My Possessions" / "Mein Eigentum"  1799.
-----
Hölderlin wrote a large number of odes in classical meters, limiting  himself primarily to alcaic and asdepiadic strophic forms.
-----
This one is alcaic  (translations only approximate to the original measures):  Hölderlin wrote the poem a year after his painful separation from the  Gontard household and at a time when he was struggling with various  plans to support himself as a writer.
-----
Hölderlin's precarious existence in a  politically and economically oppressive civil society resonates here with the  transcendental homelessness that was to become one of the central themes  of his elegies and hymns.
-----
As this ode already suggests, a condition of  material and spiritual desolation can make one vulnerable to the self-  destructive impulse to seek unmediated contact with the gods.
-----
"Heidelberg"  1798-1800.
-----
The ode is asdepiadic:  Hölderlin was in Heidelberg on at least two occasions.
-----
The central strophes  most likely allude to his visit in 1795 after his sudden departure from Jena  in a state of great emotional distress.
-----
"The Course of Life" / "Lebenslauf"  1798-99.
-----
Asdepiadic.
-----
In April 1797 Hölderlin writes to his sister: "It's not  a bad thing if a young man strives beyond himself; but a more mature life  curves back once more to what is human and serene."
-----
290 • Endnotes  «The Rtfcwer / "Der Abschied"  1798-1800.
-----
Asdepiadic The labor of mourning performed in die poem is  particularly harsh, even violent: the lily at the end of the poem—in Höld-  erlin flowers are often associated with poetic language—appears to be  linked to a bleeding away of desire.
-----
"Nature and Art" / "Natur und Kunst"  1800-01.
-----
Alcaic Saturn, the god of the golden age, was dethroned by his  son Jupiter.
-----
Hölderlin identifies Kronos (Saturn) with Chronos (time),  which makes Jupiter both "the son of Kronos" (Kronion) and of time.
-----
The  relation between the gods (and what they represent) anticipates die relation  between the Dionysian and the Apollinian principles in Nietzsche's Birth of  Tragedy.
-----
"Hie Poet's Vocation" / "Dichterberuf"  1800-01 (expansion of shorter poem, T o Our Great Poets" written 1798).
-----
Alcaic.
-----
One of the central questions of Hölderlin's mature writings concerns  the task of the poet in desolate times, which are associated here with the  predominance of instrumental reason in human affairs.
-----
In the final lines the  poet's unique relation to God's absence displaces the emphasis in an earlier  version on the relation of mortals in general to God's proximity ("And  neither honors nor weapons are / Needed, as long as die God remains  near.")
-----
It is unclear whether in the final version Hölderlin is being ironic or suggesting, radier, that the poet's vocation is precisely to discover, by way of  a certain negative theology, the spiritual resources of an absent God.
-----
"Voice of the Ffeople" / "Stimme des Volks*  1799-1800.
-----
Alcaic.
-----
The origin of the proverb that informs the poem, "vox  populi, vox dei," is uncertain.
-----
The city of Xanthos was twice besieged: by  the Persians between 546 and 539 B.C.
-----
and by Brutus in 42 B.C.
-----
The ode  contains the most explicit reference in all of Hölderlin's writings to a  suicidal (repetition) compulsion to undo individuation, particularly at mo-  ments of great danger.
-----
Endnotes • 291  "Chiron"  Between 1802 and early 1804, Hölderlin revised three earlier odes and  included them among the nine poems he sent to Friedrich Wilmans for  publication in his Taschenbuch für das Jahr 1805.
-----
Hölderlin referred to  diese poems as Nachtgesänge (Nightsongs).
-----
The three odes were: "Chiron,"  a reworking of "Der blinde Sänger" (The blind poet); "Blödigkeit," a reworking of "Dichtermut" (The poet's courage); and "Ganymed," a reworking of "Der gefesselte Strom" (The fettered river).
-----
Chiron was die wise and just among die centaurs and, having been instructed in the arts of  medicine, music, prophecy, and hunting by Apollo and Artemis, became the  teacher of various Achaen heroes such as Jason and Achilles* While hunting,  he was inadvertently struck by one of Heradesfc poisoned arrows.
-----
Rather  than bear the pain, Chiron agreed to give up his immortality to Prometheus,  thus fulfilling die prophecy that the latter would be redeemed only if a god  would die for him* Heracles kills the eagle that had fed on Prometheus' liver  and tells Zeus of Chiron's desire to die for Prometheus.
-----
The word "clouds"  in die penultimate strophe may be a translation of the Greek niphos,  meaning "cloud" as well as "horde" or "band"  "Timidness" / "Blödigkeit"  See note to "Chiron."
-----
In the final strophe Hölderlin creates a series of puns using derivations of die verb schicken (to send).
-----
Geschickt, the past partici-ple of schicken, can also mean skillful; the noun Geschick denotes skill as well as fete or destiny (related to Schicksat).
-----
Schicklich connotes suitable, becoming, within the limits of propriety*  "Ganymed"  See note to "Chiron."
-----
Ganymede was the legendary Trojan prince whose  beauty so captivated Zeus that the god assumed the form of an eagle and  carried him off to Olympus to be his cupbearer*  "Menon's Lament for Diotima" / "Menons Klage um Diotima"  Hölderlin's elegies, written 1799-1801, are "elegiac" in both form and  content.
-----
That is, they are poems of lament and they are written in elegiac    292 • Endnotes  distichs (alternating dactylic hexameters and pentameters; sometimes  thought of as coupled hexameters, the second with a masculine caesura after  the third beat), one of the oldest Greek verse forms, naturalized in Germany  in the eighteenth century.
-----
Hölderlin developed his conception of the theme  and tone erf elegiac poetry within the framework of Schiller's notion of the  genre as a subclass of sentimental poetry.
-----
As performed by Hölderlin, the  elegist's lament often takes on hymnic character: die work erf mourning a  lost state of erotic or spiritual fulfillment (and thereby of renewing one's  attachments to the world of the living) may open up to visionary projections  erf a future state erf fulfillment and unity to be achieved, at least in part, in  and through die language erf poetry.
-----
"Bread and Wine" / "Brod und Wein99  In July, 1796, Hölderlin, Susette Gontard, and her four children arrived in  Kassel as refugees from Frankfurt, which had been overrun by Napoleon's  army.
-----
Their host in Kassel was Wilhelm Heinse, a friend of the Gontard  family and author of the novel Ardinghello (1787).
-----
Both the novel and its  author influenced Hölderlin's own novel Hyperion.
-----
The first strophe was  published separately by Leo von Seckendorf in his Musenalmanach für das  Jahr 1807 under the title "Die Nacht" and is known to have had a powerful impact on, among others, Clemens Brentano, who cites several lines from  the poem nearly verbatim in his own "Märchen von Gockel, Hinkel und  Gackeleia."
-----
The poem, which was first published in its entirety in 1894 (and  at an earlier stage was called "Der Weingott"), mixes together allusions to Dionysus and to Christ.
-----
As gods who experienced death and rebirth and  whose presence is furthermore preserved in a symbolic form—in bread and  wine—providing comfort in the promise of later renewal, they are par-  ticularly well suited to be the patron deities of elegiac poetry.
-----
(This mixing  erf Hellenic and biblical traditions is typical of Hölderlin's later work.)
-----
In die  poem Hölderlin achieves the mythopoetic vision of history that will domi-  nate the later hymns; according to this vision, the poet's vocation is to  prepare his community for a new epiphany, which will bring to an ecstatic  conclusion the spiritual darkness that has plagued humankind since the  withdrawal of the gods at the end of the Golden Age of Greek antiquity.
-----
To  accomplish this task the poet must draw upon the salvific resources erf the  present moment erf danger.
-----
Hiebe: a river nymph.
-----
Ismenos: river near the city erf Thebes.

Cadmus: founder erf Thebes; his daughter, Semele, was die mother of    Endnotes • 293  Dionysus.
-----
Cithaeron, a mountain near Thebes, was the site of Dionysian  rites.

The Syrian: perhaps a condensation of Dionysus and Christ; both bring  consolation to a nocturnal (underworld.
-----
«Half of life" / "Hälfte des Lebens"  One of the "Nightsongs?
-----
written in late 1802 and 1803 for oilman's  Taschenbuch für das Jahr 1805.
-----
The first drafts of the poem appear to have grown out of Hölderlin's efforts to complete his first large hymnic work  after Pindar, "As on a Holiday.. • •"  "The Shelter at H a h r d r / " D e r Winkel von Hahrdt"  One of the "Nightsongs."
-----
According to a Swabian legend, in 1519 Duke  Ulrich of Württemberg hid from enemy nobles in the "Ulrich Stone," a  natural shelter formed by two large slabs of sandstone in the woods near  Nürtigen.
-----
"Ages of Life" / "Lebensalter"  One of the "Nightsongs."
-----
The city of Palmyra was decimated by the Romans  in 273.
-----
Hölderlin's vision of the ruins of Palmyra was perhaps influenced by  the poem "Die Ruinen von Palmyra" published in the first volume of the  Englische Blätter (1793) edited by Ludwig Schubart, and the description of  the deserted city in the first chapter of Volney's Les Ruines, ou meditations  sur les revolutions des empires (1791).
-----
The contrast between the worlds  separated in the poem by the semicolon resonates with Hölderlin's vision of  die fundamental differences between Greek antiquity and modern Germany  elaborated in his letter to Böhlendorff of December 4,1801 (see introduc-  tion).
-----
Sieburth's translation follows D. E. Satder's reconstruction of the  poem in the Einleitung to die Frankfurter Ausgabe.
-----
"As on a holiday.•."
-----
/ "Wie wenn am Feiertage«.."  End of 1799.
-----
The first of the late hymnic works in which Hölderlin tries to  adapt die triadic construction of die Pindaric ode—die progression from  strophe to antistrophe to epode—to the historical and spiritual experience    294 • Endnotes  of Hesperidean man.
-----
In this first and, as it turned out, fragmentary attempt,  Hölderlin also tries to imitate Pindar's patterns of metrical responsion.
-----
In  the first prose drafts of the poem Hölderlin draws upon his translation of  the prologue of Euripidesfe Bacchae, the first lines of which refer to die mythic birth of Dionysus from die union of Zeus and Semele.
-----
"At the Source of the Danube" / "Am Quell der Donau"  1801.
-----
Hölderlin's major hymns were written for the most part between  1801 and 1803.
-----
Hölderlin characterized the tone of his hymnic work as the  "high and pure jubilation of patriotic songs'9 (das hohe und reine  Frohlocken vaterländischer Gesänge) in contrast to die "tired flight" of love songs that were more typical of the period.
-----
Some commentators have  suggested that "As on a holiday...." remained a fragment (and should not  even be included among the vaterländische Gesänge) because Hölderlin had  not yet worked through to this more public poetic attitude and voice.
-----
The  triadic structure of "At the Source of the Danube" would be completed by  two missing strophes, which, judging from prose drafts, would have con-  tained an invocation to Mother Asia: (12,12), 15; 12,12,16; 12,12,14.
-----
The late hymns make frequent reference to geography (for example, die  course of rivers or the placement of mountains), to illustrate die westerly  migration of a world-historical spirit from Asia, to Greece and Rome, and  finally to Northern Europe.
-----
The Danube, which flows from Swabia to die  Black Sea, may thereby become the locus of a mediation between the  primordial site of an inspired humanity and a modernity awaiting spiritual  renewal.
-----
Parnassus: mountain above Delphi, sacred to Apollo and the muses.
-----
Cithaeron: mountain near Thebes; site of Dionysian rites«  Capitol: site of the temple of Jupiter in Rome.

-----
Isthmus: Isthmus at Corinth, site of the Isthmian Games.
-----
Cephissus: river near Athens.
-----
Taygetus: mountain range overlooking Sparta.
-----
Caucasus: mountain range marking for Hölderlin die boundary between  Asia and Europe.
-----
"The Migration" / "Die Wanderung"  1801.
-----
The boundaries of Swabia evoked in the first strophe reflect the  dimensions of die medieval duchy of Swabia under die Hohenstaufer.
-----
Hie    Endnotes • 295  thic union of the German tribe with the "children of die sun" may allude  a wave of Swabian emigration toward die lower basin of die Danube in  70.

-----
They called this sea Hospitable: previously referred to as "desolate," die reeks called die Black Sea "hospitable" after colonization.
-----
Cayster: river in Ionia.
-----
Taygetos: mountain range overlooking Sparta.
-----
Hymettos: mountain range southeast of Athens famous for its honey and  larble.

-----
Thetis: sea nymph, mother of Achilles.
-----
Ida: mountain range south of Troy.
-----
Graces of Greece: die Charites: Euphrosyne ("joy"), Aglaia ("brilliance"), and Thalia ("bloom").
-----
"Germanien"  1801.
-----
The flight of the eagle follows much the same path of the "voice that  moulds and makes human" in "At the Source of the Danube."
-----
The "storm, threatening death" is perhaps an allusion to die Napoleonic wars.
-----
The  "lesser ones" of the fifth strophe might be an allusion to the Romans  defeated by Germanic warriors in the Teutoburger Wald.
-----
The strophe as a  whole appears to have been influenced by Tacitus's Germania.
-----
"Der Rhein"  1801.
-----
Isaac von Sinclair, to whom the poem is dedicated, was one of  Hölderlin's closest and most loyal friends.
-----
His "Jacobin" politics led to his expulsion from the university of Jena in 1795 and to his arrest and brief  incarceration in 1805 (see chronology).
-----
In a marginal note on one of the  manuscripts of the poem, Hölderlin characterized the structure of the hymn  as follows (in Christopher Middleton's translation): "The law of this poem  [dieses Gesanges] is that the first two parts are formally opposed as pro-  gression and regression, but are alike in subject matter; the two succeeding    296 • Endnotes  parts are formally alike but are opposed as regards subjea matter; the last  part, however, balances everything out with a continuous metaphor."
-----
Höld-  erlin thus grouped the fifteen strophes of the hymn into five sets of three  strophes each (triad).
-----
The terms "progression" and "regression** may refer to die movement of thought and voice through the three major poetic  tonalities as conceived by Hölderlin: naive, heroic, ideal.
-----
Each tonality gives  voice to a different position, attitude, and existential mood vis-ä-vis the  heroic destiny that is the central theme of the poem.
-----
Morea: the Peloponnesus (southern part of Greece).
-----
Ticino, Rhodanus: rivers that rise near the source of the Rhine in the  Swiss Alps.
-----
Toward Asia: the Rhine flows eastward from its source before turning  northward in the Graubünden mountains.
-----
He rends the snakes: allusion to Heracles struggling with the snakes  placed in his cradle by Hera.
-----
Rousseau: Hölderlin wrote an (unfinished) ode to Rousseau around the  turn of the century.
-----
He was important to Hölderlin as the first great modern  psychologist of alienation and as prophet of revolutionary change.
-----
Lake Bienne: Rousseau took refuge on the Beterinsel in this lake in 1765.
-----
One wise man: an allusion to Socrates at the symposium.
-----
In the steel blade: perhaps an allusion to Sinclair's revolutionary politics.
-----
"Celebration of Peace" / "Friedeiisfeier"  1801-02.
-----
The final version of this hymn was discovered in 1954 in a private  collection in London.
-----
The twelve strophes are divisible into four triads  (Hölderlin left extra spaces after every third strophe to mark the divisions).
-----
The first drafts were composed in the euphoria following the Treaty of  Lun6ville in February 1801 (see chronology).
-----
Since its publication, com-  mentators have suggested a number of possible identities of the prince of the  feast day: the genius of the people; Napoleon; Christ; the God of Peace; the  World Spirit; Helios; Dionysus; Heracles.
-----
Still others have argued that  Hölderlin has been quite careful to suspend the question of identity in the  hymn.
-----
«The Only One" / «Der Einzige"  1802; further versions 1803.
-----
The fragmentary hymn is one of Hölderlin's  ambivalent attempts to integrate Christ into the lineage of Greek gods as    Endnotes • 297  part of his effort to establish a proper measure of distance (and proximity) to him without compromising his uniqueness.
-----
Elis: region in die western Peloponnesus where Olympia lies; site of the  panhellenic games«  Smyrna... Ephesos: Greek settlements in Ionia, on the western coast of  Asia Minor.
-----
Euios: cult name of Dionysus.
-----
"Batrnos"  1802.
-----
In 1802, the Landgrave Friedrich erf Hessen-Homburg, a critic erf the  "false freedom and Jacobinism" he saw as the legacy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, commissioned Klopstock to write a poem  reaffirming traditional biblical values.
-----
When Klopstock was unable to  oblige him, Hölderlin, who met the Landgrave in Regensburg in October  1802, took on the task.
-----
Sinclair handed the poem with Hölderlin's dedication to die Landgrave on February 6,1803, on die occasion of the latter's fifty-fifth birthday.
-----
Patmos is die island in the Sporades (Aegean archipelago) where St. John die Divine is said to have written the Book of Revelations.
-----
Hölderlin shared die common assumption that this John was  identical with the apostle John.
-----
A later version merges John the Baptist with  this composite figure.
-----
The poem is perhaps Hölderlin's most powerful  evocation of die primal scene erf dispersion and fragmentation that marks  die advent of modernity for the poet, which, he suggests, is a time when the  divine is only available in the form of signs to be recollected and interpreted  Give us innocent water: the line recalls Hölderlin's translation (1799) erf  Leander's letter to Hero—i.e., from antiquity's most famous swimmer to his  beloved—from the eighteenth epistle in Ovid's Heroides.
-----
Tmolus, Taurus, Messogis: mountains in Asia Minor, now Turkey.
-----
Bearer of thunder; mystery of die vine: here as in "Bread and Wine,"  Hölderlin sometimes mingles die attributes of Christ and Dionysus.
-----
The evening had come: die world-historical night brought on by Christ's  absence.
-----
The loved one's shadow: perhaps an allusion to Christ's appearance to  die disciples on the way to Rmmaus (Luke 24:13-17.).
-----
In a later version this  shadow is compared to a plague.

To have done so later: diese difficult lines are rendered by Sieburth as  follows: "Far worse, had it / Happened later, brutally tearing men / From  their work."
-----
Beissner suggests die following reading: Later, Ufe would not    298 • Endnotes  have been good, would have been the mere work of men (and moreover a  sign of God's infidelity)» had Christ not sent the disciples the Spirit that  consoles them during the period of darkness before Parousia.

Dragons' teeth: allusion to Cadmus's sowing erf armed soldiers from the  teeth of a dragon (c£ Ovid, The Metamorphoses, 3,99-130); with five erf  these soldiers Cadmus built the city of Thebes.
-----
"Remembrance" / "Andenken"  1803 (perhaps as late as 1805).

One of the first poems to incorporate details  of the French landscape Hölderlin witnessed during his brief employment as  a private tutor in Bordeaux (see chronology).
-----
The northeasterly: the wind that blows from Germany toward Bordeaux  (and to the West Indies).

Bellarmin: the addressee of Hyperion's letters in Hölderlin's epistolary  novel.

To the Indies: the manuscript version reads Indien, while the printed text reads Indiern.

But poets establish what remains: Middleton renders the last line: "But  poets alone ordain what abides."

Ister is the ancient Greek name for the  Danube.
-----
Indus: river associated with the sacred origins of culture.

What is fitting: see note to the ode "Timidness."
-----
Hercules (Heracles): according to Pindar's Third Olympian (translated  by Hölderlin)» Hercules brought back olive trees from die source of the  Danube to provide shade for the Olympic fields.
-----
To travel backwards: for Hölderlin the Danube mediates between the  ancient origins of culture in the east and Hesperidean modernity.
-----
The Rhine, has gone away / Sideways: allusion to the easterly course of the  river at its source.
-----
Hertha: according to Tacitus, this fertility goddess was the Mother Earth  of die ancient Germans.
-----
"Mnemosyne"  1803 (perhaps as late as 1805).
-----
The Sieburth translation published here  follows D. E. Satder's reconstruction of the poem in the Einleitung to the  Frankfurter Ausgabe.
-----
The strophe that Beissner presents as the first strophe of a "third version" of the poem (replacing "A sign we a r e .

-----
If one reads fehlet to signify a lack rather than error and gleich to mean "soon," one might read the line as: "For him mourning will soon pass/9 that his, for him who gathers himself and lets go of an obsessive,  melancholic mode of memory.
-----
"The fruits are ripe..." / "Reif s i n d .

-----
The dates of composition of the five drafts of hymns published here are  generally taken to be 1801 to 1806.
-----
Before Satder's reconstruction of  "Mnemosyne" most scholars accepted Beissner's reading of "Reif sind*.. •"  as the first strophe of a third version of that hymn.
-----
Satder includes the  fragment as part of a larger collection of fragments he has entided "Ap-  rioritat des Individuellen."
